# SDD Enhanced Notification System

Implementation of TASK-014: Enhanced Notification System for Claude Code.

## Overview

This notification system provides real-time feedback on task execution progress, completion status, and failure conditions through Claude Code's hooks system, including sound alerts for key events.

## Components

### Hook Scripts

1. **sdd-session-logger.py** - SessionStart Event Handler
   - Logs session initialization
   - Sets up project context
   - Provides observability event tracking

2. **sdd-activity-logger.py** - PostToolUse Event Handler  
   - Tracks tool usage and file operations
   - Monitors workflow progress
   - Triggers progress notifications for active tasks

3. **sdd-performance-tracker.py** - SubagentStop Event Handler
   - Monitors sub-agent performance
   - Tracks agent completion status
   - Provides completion/failure notifications

4. **sdd-session-summary.py** - Stop Event Handler
   - Generates session completion summary
   - Reports final workflow status
   - Creates session logs and cleanup

### Shared Library

**lib/notification_system.py** - Core notification system with:
- Cross-platform sound notification support
- Bundle status tracking and reporting
- Security validation and error handling
- Progress feedback and status monitoring
- Failure notification with debugging guidance

### Sound Assets

**sounds/** directory contains notification audio files:
- `success.wav` - Task completion and success events
- `error.wav` - Critical failures and errors
- `warning.wav` - Non-critical warnings
- `progress.wav` - Progress updates and agent transitions

## Features Implemented

### Behavior 1: Hook Integration and Event Tracking
✅ Hook configuration for all four event types  
✅ Structured event data processing with validation  
✅ Non-blocking execution ensuring workflow continuity  
✅ Comprehensive logging and observability  

### Behavior 2: Sound Notification Implementation  
✅ Cross-platform audio playback (macOS, Linux, Windows)  
✅ Distinct sounds for different event types  
✅ Configurable sound notifications (can be disabled)  
✅ Graceful degradation when audio unavailable  

### Behavior 3: Status Reporting and Progress Feedback
✅ Bundle status monitoring and reporting  
✅ Progress tracking with completion percentages  
✅ Agent completion status tracking  
✅ Status change detection and notifications  

### Behavior 4: Failure Notification and Debugging Information
✅ Detailed failure information with context  
✅ Actionable debugging guidance generation  
✅ Critical failure immediate sound alerts  
✅ Comprehensive failure logging for review  

## Security Features

- **Input Validation**: JSON injection protection and data sanitization
- **Path Security**: Path traversal prevention in file operations
- **Sound File Security**: Validation and size limits for audio files
- **Error Handling**: Secure error logging without sensitive data exposure
- **Workspace Boundaries**: All operations restricted to project directory

## Configuration

The notification system is configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/sdd-session-logger.py"}]}],
    "PostToolUse": [{"matcher": "create_file|replace_string_in_file|run_in_terminal", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/sdd-activity-logger.py"}]}],
    "SubagentStop": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/sdd-performance-tracker.py"}]}],
    "Stop": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/sdd-session-summary.py"}]}]
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `tests/test_notification_system_updated.py` - Comprehensive behavior testing
- All four behaviors tested with security validation
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

### Integration Tests  
- `tests/test_hook_integration.py` - End-to-end hook script testing
- Real hook data processing verification
- Error handling and graceful degradation testing

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 21/22 tests passing (1 cleanup error, not functional)
- **Integration Tests**: 6/6 tests passing 
- **Hook Scripts**: All 4 scripts functional and tested

## Usage

The notification system activates automatically when Claude Code executes within the project. Hooks trigger on:

- **Session Start**: Project initialization logging
- **File Operations**: Progress notifications during active tasks  
- **Agent Completion**: Success/failure alerts for bundler, coder, validator agents
- **Session End**: Summary report with task status overview

## Logs and Output

Logs are written to `.claude/logs/`:
- `hooks.jsonl` - General hook event logging
- `failures.jsonl` - Failure information for debugging  
- `session_summary_<session_id>.json` - Session completion summaries

## Error Handling

All hooks follow fail-safe design principles:
- Never prevent workflows from proceeding  
- Log errors to stderr without workflow disruption
- Always exit with code 0 regardless of internal errors
- Graceful degradation when systems unavailable

## Performance

Hook execution is optimized for minimal impact:
- Target execution time < 100ms per hook
- Non-blocking sound playback
- Minimal file I/O operations
- Lightweight processing for observability focus

# SDD Requirements Consistency Framework

This framework ensures consistent requirement referencing and validation across all phases of the Spec-Driven Development methodology. It prevents requirement ID invention, maintains cross-reference accuracy, and ensures proper traceability throughout the specification hierarchy.

## Universal Validation Process

### Before Any Specification Work
Every specialist agent and Main Agent must complete these validation steps:

1. **Source Document Analysis**: Read the actual requirements document to identify real ID formats (REQ-001, NFR-001, etc.)
2. **Reference Validation**: Never invent requirement IDs - only reference IDs that exist in source documents
3. **Cross-Reference Check**: Ensure all references trace correctly to actual requirements
4. **Hierarchy Consistency**: Ensure lower-level specifications correctly reference higher-level specifications

### Requirement ID Standards by Phase

#### Vision Phase
- **No requirement IDs**: Vision is the strategic document that establishes purpose and goals
- **Provides foundation**: All subsequent requirements must trace back to vision goals
- **Strategic focus**: Establishes the "why" that drives all requirement decisions

#### Requirements Phase  
- **Creates source IDs**: Establishes REQ-001, NFR-001 format as authoritative source
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All functional and non-functional requirements identified
- **Traceable to vision**: Every requirement must support stated vision goals

#### Architecture Phase
- **References source IDs**: Must reference actual REQ-XXX, NFR-XXX from requirements document
- **Addresses NFRs**: Architecture decisions must explicitly address all relevant NFRs
- **No new requirements**: Architecture may not introduce new requirements not in source

#### Roadmap Phase  
- **Groups requirements**: References specific requirements for each milestone
- **Maintains traceability**: Clear mapping from roadmap features to requirement IDs
- **Sequence validation**: Milestone ordering must respect requirement dependencies

#### Milestone Planning Phase
- **References roadmap**: Must reference actual roadmap milestones and their requirements
- **Maintains scope**: Cannot add requirements not present in roadmap milestone
- **Clear boundaries**: Explicit statement of which requirements are in/out of scope

#### Task Blueprint Phase
- **References milestones**: Must reference specific milestone plans and their requirement scope
- **Atomic mapping**: Each task must clearly map to specific requirements
- **Implementation clarity**: Task contracts must be traceable to original requirements

## Validation Checklist (All Phases)

Before any document creation or revision, verify:

- [ ] **Source Document Review**: Actual requirements document reviewed for ID formats
- [ ] **Reference Verification**: All requirement references checked against source document
- [ ] **No Invented IDs**: Confirmed no requirement IDs were created without source authorization
- [ ] **Cross-Reference Tracing**: All references trace correctly through specification hierarchy
- [ ] **Requirement Text Matching**: Referenced requirement descriptions match source specifications
- [ ] **Scope Boundary Respect**: All additions stay within higher-level specification boundaries
- [ ] **Traceability Validation**: Clear path from task/milestone back to original requirements

## Cross-Phase Consistency Rules

### Vision → Requirements Consistency
- Every functional requirement must support at least one vision goal
- Non-functional requirements must align with stated quality expectations
- Requirements scope must not exceed vision boundaries
- Mission statement must be reflected in core functional requirements

### Requirements → Architecture Consistency  
- Every NFR must be explicitly addressed in architecture decisions
- Technology stack must support all functional requirements
- Architecture constraints must not conflict with requirement specifications
- Performance, security, and scalability NFRs must have architectural solutions

### Architecture → Roadmap Consistency
- Roadmap milestones must align with architectural dependencies
- Technology implementation must support roadmap timeline
- Infrastructure requirements must be reflected in milestone planning
- Technical constraints must influence milestone sequencing

### Roadmap → Milestone Plan Consistency
- Milestone plans must deliver exactly the value stated in roadmap
- Task sequences must respect architectural constraints from earlier phases
- Milestone scope must not exceed roadmap milestone boundaries
- Implementation approach must follow architectural guidance

### Milestone Plan → Task Blueprint Consistency
- All TASK-XXX identifiers in milestone plans must have corresponding blueprints
- Task acceptance criteria must align with milestone success criteria
- Implementation approach must follow both architectural and milestone guidance
- Context requirements must support architectural compliance

## Error Prevention Patterns

### Common Consistency Failures
1. **Requirement ID Invention**: Creating REQ-XXX IDs without source document authorization
2. **Cross-Reference Breaking**: References that don't trace back to source documents
3. **Scope Creep**: Adding requirements not present in higher-level specifications
4. **Orphaned Requirements**: Requirements that don't support higher-level goals
5. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Using different terms for the same concept across phases

### Quality Assurance Integration
- **Template Compliance**: All requirement references must follow established formats
- **Validation Hooks**: Automated checking where possible for reference consistency
- **Review Gates**: Human Architect validation of requirement consistency at phase transitions
- **Traceability Reports**: Regular verification of end-to-end requirement traceability

## Automated Validation Opportunities

### Reference Checking
- Verify all REQ-XXX, NFR-XXX references exist in source documents
- Check cross-reference consistency between specification levels
- Validate requirement text matches across document references

### Scope Boundary Validation
- Ensure milestone scope stays within roadmap boundaries
- Verify task blueprints don't exceed milestone scope
- Check that architecture doesn't introduce unauthorized requirements

### Traceability Verification
- Validate complete traceability chains from vision to implementation
- Check for orphaned requirements that don't trace to vision goals
- Ensure all milestone deliverables map to specific requirements

## Success Indicators

### Process Quality Metrics
- Zero invented requirement IDs in specification documents
- 100% traceability from task blueprints back to vision goals
- Consistent requirement terminology across all specification phases
- Reduced cross-reference errors in document reviews

### Outcome Quality Metrics
- Clear understanding of requirement origins at implementation level
- Reduced scope creep and requirement drift during development
- Improved stakeholder confidence in requirement coverage
- Better alignment between delivered features and original vision

This framework ensures that the SDD methodology maintains rigorous requirement consistency while enabling clear traceability from strategic vision through tactical implementation.

# SDD Persona & Vocabulary Guide

This guide establishes consistent persona awareness and vocabulary standards across all phases of the Spec-Driven Development methodology. It ensures clear communication between Human Architects and AI agents throughout the specification hierarchy.

## Core SDD Personas

### Human Architect
Strategic decision maker across all specification phases who provides vision, requirements clarification, and final approval at phase gates. The Human Architect focuses on the "what" and "why" while delegating the "how" to appropriate specialists.

### Main Agent (Claude Code)
Conversation facilitator and coordinator who handles user interaction and delegates to appropriate specialists. The Main Agent does NOT create documents except Vision through conversational guidance. Its primary role is orchestration and ensuring proper specialist invocation.

### Specialist Sub-Agents
Domain experts with clean contexts who create documents and provide strategic analysis:

- **Requirements Specialist**: Analyzes vision documents and researches domain patterns to create comprehensive product requirements with proper FR/NFR identification
- **Architecture Specialist**: Transforms requirements into technical architecture through research-driven decision making and technology evaluation
- **Roadmap Specialist**: Creates strategic delivery plans with milestone sequencing and vertical slice methodology
- **Milestone Planning Specialist**: Converts roadmap milestones into detailed tactical plans with task breakdowns and acceptance criteria
- **Task Blueprint Specialist**: Creates atomic, executable task specifications with clear contracts and context requirements
- **Bundler Specialist**: Research specialist that gathers context through semantic codebase analysis and document comprehension
- **Coder Specialist**: Implementation specialist using TDD principles and document understanding to generate architecturally compliant code
- **Validator Specialist**: Quality assurance specialist using comprehensive testing, linting, security scanning, and validation approaches

## Universal Vocabulary Standards

### ✅ USE THESE TERMS (All Phases)
- "reads and understands documents"
- "[Agent Name] analyzes using natural language understanding"
- "comprehends specification content"
- "identifies patterns through document analysis"
- "Human Architect provides strategic guidance"
- "Claude Code agent implements based on document comprehension"
- "Specialist analyzes and creates recommendations"
- "Agent uses semantic understanding to identify relevant code"

### ❌ NEVER USE THESE TERMS
- "parses" (implies programmatic parser)
- "extracts data" (implies algorithmic extraction)
- "the system processes" (vague, specify which agent)
- "automatically generates" (specify which agent and method)
- "processes files" (use "reads and understands files")
- "system analyzes" (specify which agent analyzes)

## Phase-Specific Vocabulary Applications

### Vision Phase
- "Human Architect articulates project vision"
- "Main Agent facilitates conversational vision development"
- "Vision emerges through strategic dialogue"

### Requirements Phase
- "Requirements Specialist analyzes vision document and researches domain patterns"
- "Human Architect provides strategic requirements clarification"
- "Specialist identifies functional and non-functional requirements through research"

### Architecture Phase
- "Architecture Specialist comprehends requirements and researches technical patterns"
- "Human Architect makes final architectural decisions"
- "Specialist evaluates technology options based on requirements analysis"

### Roadmap Phase
- "Roadmap Specialist understands all prior specifications and creates delivery strategy"
- "Human Architect approves milestone sequencing and priorities"
- "Specialist analyzes requirements to determine logical milestone progression"

### Milestone Planning Phase
- "Milestone Planning Specialist reads roadmap and creates detailed tactical plans"
- "Task Blueprint Specialist creates individual task specifications"
- "Human Architect approves milestone plans before implementation"
- "Specialists comprehend higher-level specifications to create executable plans"

### Implementation Phase
- "Bundler Specialist analyzes local codebase through semantic understanding"
- "Coder Specialist reads task blueprints and context bundles to generate code"
- "Validator Specialist performs comprehensive quality checks"
- "Human Architect makes decisions on validation failures"
- "Agents use natural language comprehension to understand existing code patterns"

## Implementation Guidelines for Agents

### When You See Technical-Sounding Instructions
- "Parse the milestone plan" → Read and understand the milestone plan document using natural language comprehension
- "Extract TASK-XXX patterns" → Identify TASK-XXX patterns through document analysis
- "Process the architecture" → Read and comprehend the architecture specifications
- "Generate requirements" → Analyze vision and research to create comprehensive requirements

### Document Comprehension Approach
As an AI agent in the SDD system, you read and understand documents as an intelligent analyst, not as a programmatic parser. You:
- Use your natural language understanding to comprehend document structure and content
- Identify patterns and relationships through semantic analysis
- Extract meaning and intent rather than just parsing syntax
- Apply domain knowledge and research to create comprehensive outputs

### Context and Collaboration
- Always specify which persona (Human Architect or specific Specialist) performs each action
- Distinguish between strategic work (Human Architect) and implementation work (Specialists)
- Use clean context isolation - each Specialist operates with focused, relevant information
- Maintain clear handoffs between phases with explicit approval gates

This vocabulary guide ensures consistent, clear communication throughout the SDD methodology while maintaining proper persona awareness and avoiding implementation confusion.

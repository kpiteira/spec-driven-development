# Planning Retrospective: M6 Brownfield Support (January 17, 2025)

## Planning Duration
- **Total Time**: Extended session (continuation from previous context)
- **Breakdown**: 
  - Initial milestone planning: Moderate
  - Task organization fixes: Significant time due to confusion
  - Task blueprint creation: Efficient once properly organized

## Agent Self-Analysis
**Process Issues Encountered:**
- **Major Task Organization Confusion**: Slices 2-4 had illogical task placement, duplicated tasks (TASK-040 appeared twice), and confused task sequence
- **Shallow Initial Planning**: Started with single-sentence task descriptions that prevented end-to-end thinking
- **Slice Boundary Confusion**: Initially separated documentation and code analysis artificially instead of logical parallel execution

**Specialist Performance Issues:**
- **Milestone Planning Specialist**: Created comprehensive content but missed logical flow validation
- **Task Blueprint Specialist**: Technically competent but failed to capture task essence despite verbose output

## Human Architect Critical Feedback

### 1. Shallow Task Details Prevent End-to-End Thinking
**Issue**: Initial task descriptions were too shallow, making it impossible to think through implementation properly.
**Impact**: Required extensive user prompting to reach proper detail level achieved in final M6 plan.
**Root Cause**: `/plan_milestone` command doesn't require deep enough implementation thinking.

### 2. Poor Strategic Questions from Specialists  
**Issue**: Specialist questions were either bikeshedding on mundane details or enabling massive feature creep.
**Impact**: Questions didn't focus on actual implementation work, wasted time on irrelevant concerns.
**Root Cause**: Specialist prompts don't emphasize implementation-focused strategic thinking.

### 3. Task Blueprint Template Fundamental Problems
**Issue**: Task blueprints are verbose but miss essential implementation details from milestone plan.
**Impact**: Human Architect struggles to understand if blueprints properly capture tasks.
**Root Cause**: Template structure and specialist prompts both need complete rework.

## Process Issues

### What Didn't Work:
1. **Shallow-to-Deep Progression**: Starting shallow and iterating to depth wastes time and creates confusion
2. **Strategic Question Quality**: Current specialist prompts generate unhelpful questions
3. **Template Verbosity vs Essence**: Task blueprints lose implementation clarity despite being longer
4. **End-to-End Validation**: No systematic check for logical task flow and dependencies

### What Worked Well:
1. **User-Driven Quality Standards**: Human Architect feedback successfully elevated quality
2. **Iterative Problem Solving**: Able to fix task organization issues when properly guided
3. **Final M6 Plan Quality**: Ultimate milestone plan achieved excellent detail and clarity
4. **Logical Slice Organization**: Final 4-slice structure made sense once properly organized

## Human-AI Collaboration

### Communication Issues:
- **Quality Expectations**: Agent didn't initially understand depth required until user referenced previous high-quality work
- **Implementation Focus**: Specialists asked wrong questions, not focused on actual implementation work
- **Template Translation**: Lost implementation essence when converting milestone plan to task blueprints

### Successful Patterns:
- **Direct Feedback**: User's "ultrathink the logical order" direction was immediately actionable
- **Quality References**: Pointing to previous successful work (Slice 1 quality) provided clear standard
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of organization fixes eventually succeeded

## Scope and Complexity Management

### Over-Engineering Incidents:
- **Artificial Task Separation**: Initially separated analysis tasks that should be combined
- **Template Verbosity**: Task blueprints became overly verbose without capturing essential details

### Successful Simplicity:
- **Logical Slice Flow**: Final organization follows natural implementation dependencies
- **End-to-End Thinking**: M6 plan demonstrates proper implementation detail level

## Critical System Updates Required

### 1. `/plan_milestone` Command Overhaul
**Current Problem**: Command doesn't drive deep enough implementation thinking
**Required Fix**: Update command to require the level of detail achieved in final M6 plan
**Specific Change**: Add mandatory deep implementation thinking phases before task creation

### 2. Specialist Prompt Complete Rework  
**Current Problem**: Specialists ask bikeshedding or feature creep questions, not implementation-focused ones
**Required Fix**: Rewrite all specialist prompts to focus on actual implementation work
**Specific Change**: Questions must address implementation clarity, not abstract possibilities

### 3. Task Blueprint Template Redesign
**Current Problem**: Template produces verbose output that misses implementation essence
**Required Fix**: Complete template rework to capture implementation details clearly
**Specific Change**: Focus on implementation clarity over comprehensive documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority):
1. **Update `/plan_milestone` command** to require M6-level implementation detail thinking upfront
2. **Rewrite task blueprint template** to capture implementation essence clearly
3. **Revise specialist prompts** to focus on implementation-critical strategic questions

### Process Improvements:
1. **End-to-End Validation**: Add systematic logical flow checking before task blueprint creation
2. **Quality Standards**: Reference previous high-quality work as baseline expectation
3. **Implementation Focus**: All questions and templates must prioritize implementation clarity

### Strategic Insights:
1. **Detail Level Matters**: Shallow planning creates cascading problems throughout execution
2. **Template Quality Critical**: Poor templates lose essential information despite good source material
3. **Implementation-First Thinking**: All strategic questions must serve implementation clarity

## Success Metrics for Next Planning Session

### Process Quality:
- No task organization confusion requiring major restructuring
- Strategic questions focus on implementation clarity, not abstract possibilities
- Task blueprints clearly capture implementation essence from milestone plan

### Output Quality:
- Milestone plan achieves M6-level implementation detail from start
- Task blueprints maintain implementation clarity without excessive verbosity
- Logical flow validation prevents dependency confusion

### Efficiency:
- Minimal iteration required for task organization
- Strategic questions add value rather than create confusion
- Human Architect confirmation focus on strategic decisions, not basic organization

## Integration with SDD Methodology Evolution

This retrospective reveals fundamental tooling gaps that must be addressed before the next planning session. The quality achieved in the final M6 plan demonstrates the target standard - our tools must consistently reach this level without extensive user intervention.

**Priority 1**: Update `/plan_milestone` command to drive M6-level thinking upfront
**Priority 2**: Redesign task blueprint template for implementation clarity
**Priority 3**: Rewrite specialist prompts for implementation-focused strategic questions

These improvements are essential for SDD methodology effectiveness and should be implemented before planning additional milestones.

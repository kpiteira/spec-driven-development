# Milestone Retrospectives

This directory contains retrospective analyses from completed milestones to capture learnings and improve future planning.

## Purpose

Retrospectives serve as a learning mechanism for the SDD process by:
- Capturing what worked well and what didn't
- Analyzing complexity estimates vs reality
- Documenting patterns and solutions discovered
- Providing specific recommendations for future milestones

## File Naming Convention

- `M1_[Milestone_Name]_Retrospective.md`
- `M2_[Milestone_Name]_Retrospective.md`
- etc.

Example: `M1_Project_Initialization_Retrospective.md`

## Integration with Planning

The `/plan_milestone` command reads retrospectives from this directory to:
- Apply lessons learned from previous milestones
- Avoid repeated pitfalls
- Leverage successful patterns
- Improve complexity estimation

## Template

Use the template at `../templates/6_Milestone_Retrospective_Template.md` for consistency.

## When to Create

Create a retrospective immediately after milestone completion, while experiences and insights are fresh.

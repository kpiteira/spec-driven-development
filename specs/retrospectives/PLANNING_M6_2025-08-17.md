# Planning Retrospective: M6 Brownfield Support (August 17, 2025)

## Planning Duration
- **Total Time**: Extended session (continuation from previous context)
- **Breakdown**: 
  - Initial milestone planning: Moderate
  - Task organization fixes: Significant time due to confusion
  - Task blueprint creation: Efficient once properly organized

## Agent Self-Analysis
**Process Issues Encountered:**
- **Major Task Organization Confusion**: Slices 2-4 had illogical task placement, duplicated tasks (TASK-040 appeared twice), and confused task sequence
- **Shallow Initial Planning**: Started with single-sentence task descriptions that prevented end-to-end thinking
- **Slice Boundary Confusion**: Initially separated documentation and code analysis artificially instead of logical parallel execution

**Specialist Performance Issues:**
- **Milestone Planning Specialist**: Created comprehensive content but missed logical flow validation
- **Task Blueprint Specialist**: Technically competent but failed to capture task essence despite verbose output

## Human Architect Critical Feedback

### 1. Shallow Task Details Prevent End-to-End Process Thinking
**Issue**: Initial task descriptions were too shallow, making it impossible to think through end-to-end process and user experience properly.
**Impact**: Required extensive user prompting to reach proper detail level achieved in final M6 plan.
**Root Cause Hypothesis**: Multiple potential culprits:
- `/plan_milestone` command may not drive deep enough end-to-end thinking
- Information loss between Main Agent and milestone-planning-specialist handoffs
- Milestone plan template structure may not encourage proper process thinking

### 2. Poor Strategic Questions from Specialists  
**Issue**: Specialist questions were either bikeshedding on mundane details or enabling massive feature creep.
**Impact**: Questions didn't focus on end-to-end process thinking, wasted time on irrelevant concerns.
**Root Cause Hypothesis**: Specialist prompts don't emphasize end-to-end process and experience thinking.

### 3. Task Blueprint Template Fundamental Problems
**Issue**: Task blueprints are verbose but miss essential implementation details from milestone plan.
**Impact**: Human Architect struggles to understand if blueprints properly capture tasks.
**Root Cause**: Template structure and specialist prompts both need complete rework.

## Process Issues

### What Didn't Work:
1. **Shallow-to-Deep Progression**: Starting shallow and iterating to depth wastes time and creates confusion
2. **Strategic Question Quality**: Current specialist prompts generate unhelpful questions
3. **Template Verbosity vs Essence**: Task blueprints lose implementation clarity despite being longer
4. **End-to-End Validation**: No systematic check for logical task flow and dependencies

### What Worked Well:
1. **User-Driven Quality Standards**: Human Architect feedback successfully elevated quality
2. **Iterative Problem Solving**: Able to fix task organization issues when properly guided
3. **Final M6 Plan Quality**: Ultimate milestone plan achieved excellent detail and clarity
4. **Logical Slice Organization**: Final 4-slice structure made sense once properly organized

## Human-AI Collaboration

### Communication Issues:
- **Quality Expectations**: Agent didn't initially understand depth required until user referenced previous high-quality work
- **Implementation Focus**: Specialists asked wrong questions, not focused on actual implementation work
- **Template Translation**: Lost implementation essence when converting milestone plan to task blueprints

### Successful Patterns:
- **Direct Feedback**: User's "ultrathink the logical order" direction was immediately actionable
- **Quality References**: Pointing to previous successful work (Slice 1 quality) provided clear standard
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of organization fixes eventually succeeded

## Scope and Complexity Management

### Over-Engineering Incidents:
- **Artificial Task Separation**: Initially separated analysis tasks that should be combined
- **Template Verbosity**: Task blueprints became overly verbose without capturing essential details

### Successful Simplicity:
- **Logical Slice Flow**: Final organization follows natural implementation dependencies
- **End-to-End Thinking**: M6 plan demonstrates proper implementation detail level

## Critical System Updates Required

### 1. Root Cause Analysis and System Redesign
**Hypothesis Testing Needed**: Multiple potential root causes require investigation:
- `/plan_milestone` command may not drive deep enough end-to-end process thinking
- Information loss in Main Agent â†” milestone-planning-specialist handoffs
- Milestone plan template may not encourage proper process and experience thinking
- Prompt verbosity may be contributing to confusion and information loss

### 2. End-to-End Process Focus Enhancement
**Current Problem**: Planning process doesn't think through complete user workflows and experiences
**Required Investigation**: Determine how to drive end-to-end process thinking (with some implementation insight where useful)
**Specific Change**: Shift focus from pure implementation details to holistic process and experience design

### 3. Information Transfer and Template Quality
**Current Problem**: Task blueprint template produces verbose output that loses essential process details
**Required Fix**: Investigate whether template redesign, prompt simplification, or agent handoff improvements are needed
**Specific Change**: Ensure critical process thinking from milestone planning transfers intact to task blueprints

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority):
1. **Root Cause Investigation**: Test hypotheses about command vs agent handoffs vs template vs prompt verbosity
2. **Process Thinking Enhancement**: Determine how to drive M6-level end-to-end process thinking upfront
3. **Information Transfer Analysis**: Identify where essential details are lost between milestone planning and task blueprints

### Process Improvements:
1. **End-to-End Process Validation**: Add systematic workflow and experience checking before task blueprint creation
2. **Quality Standards**: Reference previous high-quality work as baseline expectation
3. **Process-First Focus**: All questions and templates must prioritize complete user workflow thinking

### Strategic Insights:
1. **Process Detail Level Critical**: Shallow process thinking creates cascading problems throughout execution
2. **Information Transfer Fragility**: Essential process insights are easily lost in agent handoffs and template translations
3. **End-to-End Experience Focus**: Strategic questions must serve complete workflow and experience clarity

## Success Metrics for Next Planning Session

### Process Quality:
- No task organization confusion requiring major restructuring
- Strategic questions focus on end-to-end process clarity, not bikeshedding or feature creep
- Task blueprints clearly capture essential process thinking from milestone plan

### Output Quality:
- Milestone plan achieves M6-level end-to-end process detail from start
- Task blueprints maintain process clarity without losing essential information in verbose output
- Logical workflow validation prevents dependency confusion

### Efficiency:
- Minimal iteration required for task organization and process flow
- Strategic questions add value to workflow understanding rather than create confusion
- Human Architect confirmation focuses on strategic process decisions, not basic organization

## Integration with SDD Methodology Evolution

This retrospective reveals fundamental tooling gaps that must be investigated and addressed before the next planning session. The quality achieved in the final M6 plan demonstrates the target standard - our tools must consistently reach this level without extensive user intervention.

**Priority 1**: Root cause investigation - test hypotheses about command, agent handoffs, template, and prompt verbosity
**Priority 2**: Enhance end-to-end process thinking capabilities throughout the planning workflow  
**Priority 3**: Fix information transfer issues that lose essential process details between milestone planning and task blueprints

These investigations and improvements are essential for SDD methodology effectiveness and should be completed before planning additional milestones.

# Milestone Plan: [Milestone Name, e.g., M1 - Minimum Viable Product]

**Purpose of this document:** This document provides a detailed, tactical plan for executing a single milestone from the Project Roadmap. It is the primary input for the `Supervisor Agent`, containing the precise sequence of work and the quality gates required to consider the milestone complete.

**Link to Roadmap:** `[Link to Roadmap.md]`

## 1. Milestone Goals & Success Criteria

**What it is:** A clear statement of what this milestone aims to achieve and how we will measure its success. This section answers the question, "Why are we doing this work?"

**Example:**

* **Goal:** To launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves the core problem for our primary user persona ("Sam the Small Business Owner") and validates that we are building something people want.
* **Success Criteria:**
  * Achieve 100 active users within 30 days of launch.
  * At least 20% of users successfully publish a website.
  * The system maintains >99.5% uptime during the initial launch period.

---

## 2. Scope: Features & Requirements

**What it is:** A definitive list of the features and user stories that are included in this milestone. This sets the boundaries for the work to be done.

**Example:**

* **Functional Requirements In Scope:**
  * `REQ-001`: User Signup
  * `REQ-002`: User Login
  * `REQ-004`: Basic Website Editor
  * `REQ-005`: Single-Page Website Publishing

---

## 3. Implementation Plan: Vertical Slices

**What it is:** The core of the plan. The work for this milestone is broken down into a sequence of **Vertical Slices**. Each slice represents a small, demonstrable, and testable piece of end-to-end functionality that delivers user value. The `Supervisor Agent` will execute the slices in this order.

**Best Practices:**

* A slice should be small enough to be completed in a short amount of time but large enough to deliver coherent value.
* Each slice must be independently testable.

### **Slice 1: User Signup Flow**

* **Goal:** A new user can create an account in the system.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a user provides a valid email and password on the signup page,
  * **When** they submit the form,
  * **Then** a new user record is created in the database,
  * **And** they are redirected to the login page with a success message.
* **Task Sequence:**
    1. **TASK-001:** Create `users` table in the database with `id`, `email`, `password_hash`.
    2. **TASK-002:** Create API endpoint `POST /api/users` for user signup.
    3. **TASK-003:** Build frontend signup page with a form for email and password.
    4. **TASK-004:** Write an end-to-end test that simulates the full signup flow.

---

### **Slice 2: User Login & Session Management**

* **Goal:** An existing user can log in and the system recognizes them.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an existing user is on the login page,
  * **When** they submit their correct credentials,
  * **Then** the system returns a session token (e.g., a JWT),
  * **And** they are redirected to their dashboard.
* **Task Sequence:**
    1. **TASK-005:** Create API endpoint `POST /api/sessions` for user login.
    2. **TASK-006:** Build frontend login page and handle session token storage.
    3. **TASK-007:** Create a protected API endpoint that requires a valid session token.
    4. **TASK-008:** Write an end-to-end test for the login flow and accessing a protected resource.

## 4. Testing & Verification Plan

**What it is:** A set of specific quality gates that the `Validator Agent` will enforce. This now includes checks for each slice and for the milestone as a whole.

**Example:**

* **Project-Level Checks (Always On):**
  * Linter (`eslint --fix .`) must pass.
  * Security Scanner (`snyk test`) must report zero high-severity vulnerabilities.
* **Unit Testing (A Task-Level Concern):**
  * While not specified in this milestone plan, it is an implicit requirement that all new code produced for a task is accompanied by sufficient unit tests. The specific requirements for unit tests are defined within each `Task Blueprint`.
* **Per-Slice Checks (Integration & E2E Tests):**
  * After each slice is completed, the specific end-to-end tests defined in its "Task Sequence" must pass. These tests verify that the components of the slice work together correctly to deliver user value.
* **Final Milestone Acceptance Tests:**
  * After all slices are complete, a full regression test suite is run.
  * A performance test is run on all new public-facing API endpoints.

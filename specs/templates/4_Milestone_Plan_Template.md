# Milestone Plan: [Milestone Name, e.g., M1 - Minimum Viable Product]

**Purpose of this document:** This document provides a detailed, tactical plan for executing a single milestone from the Project Roadmap. It enables Claude Code agents to read and understand milestone execution requirements, containing the precise sequence of work and quality gates required for milestone completion. This plan will be implemented by the `/milestone` command using sequential task execution.

**Link to Roadmap:** `[Link to Roadmap.md]`

## Planning Guidelines for Milestone Planning Specialists

**Requirements Validation:** Before creating this milestone plan, verify all requirement references against the actual requirements document (`1_Product_Requirements.md`). Use only existing REQ-XXX, NFR-XXX identifiers - never invent new requirement IDs.

**Scope Boundaries:** This milestone must deliver only the features specified in the roadmap milestone. Any additions must be explicitly justified against higher-level specifications and approved by the Human Architect.

**Simplicity First:** Start with sequential task execution unless parallel execution provides clear value. Focus on the simplest implementation approach that delivers the roadmap value.

**Generic Capability:** Use examples that demonstrate this plan can be executed by the `/milestone [name]` command for any milestone, not just specific milestone names.

## 1. Milestone Goals & Success Criteria

**What it is:** A clear statement of what this milestone aims to achieve and how we will measure its success. This section answers the question, "Why are we doing this work?"

**Example:**

* **Goal:** To launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves the core problem for our primary user persona ("Sam the Small Business Owner") and validates that we are building something people want.
* **Success Criteria:**
  * Achieve 100 active users within 30 days of launch.
  * At least 20% of users successfully publish a website.
  * The system maintains >99.5% uptime during the initial launch period.

---

## 2. Scope: Features & Requirements

**What it is:** A definitive list of the features and user stories that are included in this milestone. This sets the boundaries for the work to be done.

**Example:**

* **Functional Requirements In Scope:**
  * `REQ-001`: User Signup
  * `REQ-002`: User Login
  * `REQ-004`: Basic Website Editor
  * `REQ-005`: Single-Page Website Publishing

## 3. Implementation Plan: Vertical Slices

**What it is:** The core of the plan. The work for this milestone is broken down into a sequence of **Vertical Slices**. Each slice represents a small, demonstrable, and testable piece of end-to-end functionality that delivers user value. The `Supervisor Agent` will execute the slices in this order.

**Best Practices:**

* A slice should be small enough to be completed in a short amount of time but large enough to deliver coherent value.
* Each slice must be independently testable.
* **Each slice should solve a user problem in the simplest possible way** - avoid over-engineering or complex solutions when simple ones work.

**Task Description Requirements:**

* **Never use single sentences** - they hide complexity and enable misinterpretation
* **Each task needs _at least_ a full paragraph** explaining the complete scope, key challenges, and critical decisions
* **Think end-to-end** - describe the complete workflow, not just the technical component
* **Surface hidden complexity** - what seems simple but is actually complex?
* **Include edge cases** - what could go wrong and how do we handle it?

### **Slice 1: User Signup Flow**

* **Goal:** A new user can create an account in the system.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a user provides a valid email and password on the signup page,
  * **When** they submit the form,
  * **Then** a new user record is created in the database,
  * **And** they are redirected to the login page with a success message.
* **Task Sequence:**

**TASK-001: Create user database schema with security and extensibility**

This task establishes the foundational data model for user management that must handle both immediate signup needs and future authentication features. The schema includes user identification, secure password storage, account status tracking, and extensibility for future features like email verification, roles, and profile data. Critical considerations include password hash storage using bcrypt with proper salt rounds, unique constraints on email with case-insensitive handling, account status flags for email verification and deactivation, created/updated timestamps for audit trails, and database indexes for performance. The implementation must also consider data migration paths for future schema changes and comply with data protection requirements.

**TASK-002: Build secure user registration API endpoint with validation and error handling**

This task creates the API endpoint that handles user registration with comprehensive input validation, security measures, and proper error responses. The endpoint validates email format and uniqueness, enforces password strength requirements, implements rate limiting to prevent abuse, handles edge cases like duplicate registrations gracefully, and provides clear error messages without revealing security information. The implementation includes input sanitization to prevent injection attacks, proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios, audit logging for security monitoring, and integration with the database layer with proper transaction handling.

**TASK-003: Create responsive signup page with real-time validation and accessibility**

This task builds the frontend signup interface that provides an excellent user experience while collecting the necessary information securely. The page includes real-time email validation with duplicate checking, password strength indicators with helpful guidance, accessible form design following WCAG guidelines, responsive layout for mobile and desktop, proper form submission handling with loading states, and clear error display with specific field-level feedback. The implementation handles network failures gracefully, prevents double-submission, and provides keyboard navigation support.

**TASK-004: Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing covering success and failure scenarios**

This task creates automated tests that verify the complete signup flow works correctly across all scenarios including successful registration, validation errors, server failures, and edge cases. The tests cover happy path user journey from page load to successful registration, email validation with various invalid formats, password validation with weak passwords, duplicate email handling, network failure recovery, and accessibility compliance verification. The implementation includes both automated browser tests and API-level integration tests to ensure reliability.

### **Slice 2: User Login & Session Management**

* **Goal:** An existing user can log in and the system recognizes them.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an existing user is on the login page,
  * **When** they submit their correct credentials,
  * **Then** the system returns a session token (e.g., a JWT),
  * **And** they are redirected to their dashboard.
* **Task Sequence:**

**TASK-005: Create secure authentication API endpoint with session management**

This task builds the authentication endpoint that verifies user credentials and establishes secure sessions. The endpoint handles email/password validation against stored user records, implements secure password comparison using constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks, generates secure session tokens (JWT or similar) with appropriate expiration times, implements login attempt rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, and handles various authentication failure scenarios with appropriate error responses. The implementation includes session token structure with user claims, token refresh mechanisms for long-lived sessions, secure token storage considerations, and integration with password reset workflows.

**TASK-006: Build secure login interface with session token handling and user feedback**

This task creates the frontend login experience that securely collects credentials and manages authentication state. The interface includes secure credential collection with proper form handling, client-side session token storage using secure methods (httpOnly cookies or secure localStorage), authentication state management across page loads and navigation, clear user feedback for login success/failure scenarios, and proper handling of expired or invalid sessions. The implementation addresses browser security considerations, provides loading states during authentication, handles network failures gracefully, and includes logout functionality with proper session cleanup.

**TASK-007: Implement authentication middleware and protected route infrastructure**

This task establishes the security infrastructure that protects application resources and validates user sessions. The middleware verifies session tokens on each protected request, handles token expiration and refresh logic, provides consistent authentication state to application components, implements proper authorization checking for different user roles/permissions, and includes audit logging for security monitoring. The implementation covers token validation performance optimization, graceful degradation for authentication service failures, and integration patterns for protecting both API endpoints and frontend routes.

**TASK-008: Create comprehensive authentication testing covering security scenarios and user flows**

This task builds automated tests that verify authentication works correctly and securely across all scenarios including successful login, failed authentication attempts, session management, and security edge cases. The tests cover successful authentication flow with proper session establishment, invalid credential handling with appropriate error messages, session token validation and expiration scenarios, concurrent session handling, security testing for common vulnerabilities (CSRF, session fixation, etc.), and user experience testing for authentication state management. The implementation includes both security-focused testing and user journey validation.

## 4. Testing & Verification Plan

**What it is:** A set of specific quality gates that the `Validator Agent` will enforce. This now includes checks for each slice and for the milestone as a whole.

**Example:**

* **Project-Level Checks (Always On):**
  * Linter (`eslint --fix .`) must pass.
  * Security Scanner (`snyk test`) must report zero high-severity vulnerabilities.
* **Unit Testing (A Task-Level Concern):**
  * While not specified in this milestone plan, it is an implicit requirement that all new code produced for a task is accompanied by sufficient unit tests. The specific requirements for unit tests are defined within each `Task Blueprint`.
* **Per-Slice Checks (Integration & E2E Tests):**
  * After each slice is completed, the specific end-to-end tests defined in its "Task Sequence" must pass. These tests verify that the components of the slice work together correctly to deliver user value.
* **Final Milestone Acceptance Tests:**
  * After all slices are complete, a full regression test suite is run.
  * A performance test is run on all new public-facing API endpoints.

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**What it is:** Anti-patterns that lead to over-engineered, unrealistic milestone plans. Use this section to validate your plan follows simplicity principles.

### ❌ Avoid These Patterns

* **Over-Engineering**: Creating complex systems when simple solutions exist
  * Example: Building a "milestone acceptance test parser" instead of having AI agents read test descriptions directly
* **Parsing Obsession**: Building parsers for structured data when AI agents can read documents directly
  * Example: Creating JSON extractors when agents can understand markdown naturally
* **Reinventing Infrastructure**: Creating new systems instead of leveraging existing components
  * Example: Building new validation frameworks instead of using existing test commands
* **Abstract Tasks**: Tasks without concrete deliverables or clear implementation paths
  * Example: "Design the architecture" instead of "Create config file with API endpoints"
* **Big Bang Tasks**: Tasks taking more than 8 hours to complete
  * Example: "Implement complete user management system" instead of breaking into smaller pieces

### ✅ Instead, Prefer These Patterns

* **Simple Prompt Engineering**: Use AI capabilities directly rather than building complex systems
* **Configuration Over Implementation**: Modify config files and prompts rather than writing new code
* **Extension Over Creation**: Enhance existing components rather than building from scratch
* **Concrete Deliverables**: Each task produces specific files, commands, or visible functionality
* **Template Baseline**: Match the complexity level shown in the template examples above

### Complexity Check

**Before finalizing your milestone plan, verify:**
- Average task complexity ≤ Level 2.5 (see complexity scoring in planning command)
- No individual task > Level 3 complexity
- Each task takes 2-8 hours to complete
- You can explain each task in one simple sentence
- Each task leverages existing infrastructure rather than creating new systems

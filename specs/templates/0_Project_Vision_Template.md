It ensures that all stakeholders, from developers to executives, are aligned on *why* this project exists and what it aims to achieve.

## 2. Problem Statement

*   **Problem:** Explain the specific issue or gap.
*   **Impact:** Detail the negative consequences of this problem (e.g., wasted time, lost revenue, user frustration).

**Example:**

*   Focus on the primary users who will get the most value.

**Example:**
*   **Persona 1: "Sam the Small Business Owner"**

## 4. High-Level Goals & Success Metrics

*   Connect metrics directly to the problem statement and business outcomes.

**Example:**
| Goal                               | Metric                                       | Timeframe |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Validate product-market fit        | Achieve 100 paying customers                 | 6 months  |
| Reduce barrier to entry            | 50% of new users publish a site in < 1 hour  | 3 months  |

*   We will *not* build a blogging engine initially.

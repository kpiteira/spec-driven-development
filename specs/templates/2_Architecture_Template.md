## 1. Architectural Goals and Constraints

**What it is:** This section describes the primary drivers and limitations that shape the architecture. It directly translates the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) from the PRD into architectural principles.

**Best Practices:**

* Explicitly link each goal to a business or product requirement. This justifies architectural decisions.
* Be realistic about constraints (budget, team skills, timeline).

**Example:**

| Goal / Constraint              | Driving NFRs                               | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal: High Availability**    | `NFR-003 (Uptime)`                         | The architecture must support redundancy and failover to achieve 99.9% uptime.                          |
| **Goal: Low Latency**          | `NFR-001 (Response Time)`                  | The system must be designed to minimize response times, potentially using caching and a CDN.            |
| **Goal: Scalability**          | `NFR-002 (Load Capacity)`                  | The architecture must support horizontal scaling to handle anticipated user growth.                    |
| **Constraint: AWS-First**      | `Corporate Policy`                         | The system must be built primarily using AWS services, leveraging existing corporate infrastructure.      |
| **Constraint: Small Team**     | `Team Size`                                | The architecture should favor managed services over self-hosted solutions to reduce operational overhead. |

## 2. System Architecture Overview

**What it is:** A high-level, visual representation of the system's structure. This is the "map" of the system.

**Best Practices:**

* Use a standard modeling notation like the **C4 model** (Context, Containers, Components, Code) for clarity at different zoom levels. Start with a System Context or Container diagram.
* The diagram should show the major services/components, their responsibilities, and how they communicate (e.g., REST API, message queue).
* Keep it high-level. Details of each component can be elaborated on in a later section.

**Example (Container Diagram):**
> `[Insert a diagram here. This could be a Mermaid chart, an image from a tool like Lucidchart, or a link to a Miro board.]`
>
> **Description:** The system is composed of four main containers: a React-based **Single Page Application (SPA)**, a **Backend API** (Node.js/Express), a **PostgreSQL Database**, and an **Auth Service** for handling user authentication. The SPA communicates with the Backend API via REST. The Backend API reads/writes from the database and delegates authentication to the Auth Service.

---

## 3. Technology Stack

**What it is:** A definitive list of the approved technologies, frameworks, and major libraries for the project.

**Best Practices:**

* Justify key choices. Why was this technology chosen over an alternative?
* Be specific about versions to avoid ambiguity.

**Example:**

| Category          | Technology         | Version | Justification                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**      | React              | 18.x    | Rich ecosystem, team expertise.                       |
| **Backend**       | Node.js            | 20.x    | Asynchronous, efficient I/O for an API-driven system.  |
| **Framework**     | Express.js         | 4.x     | Minimalist and unopinionated, fits our needs.         |
| **Database**      | PostgreSQL         | 15      | Robust, reliable, and strong support for JSON data.   |
| **Infrastructure**| AWS (ECS, RDS, S3) | N/A     | Corporate standard, leverages managed services.       |
| **Testing**       | Jest, Cypress      | Latest  | Industry standards for unit and E2E testing.          |

## 4. Key Design Patterns & Conventions

**What it is:** A description of mandatory patterns and conventions to ensure the codebase is consistent, predictable, and maintainable. This is a critical ruleset for the `Coder Agent`.

**Best Practices:**

* Focus on patterns that have a high impact on the overall structure and quality.
* Provide simple code examples where possible.

**Example:**

* **API Design:** All public APIs will adhere to RESTful principles and the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
* **Database Access:** All database interactions must go through a **Repository Pattern**. Direct database queries from business logic are forbidden.
* **State Management (Frontend):** Global state will be managed using `Redux Toolkit`.
* **Asynchronous Operations (Backend):** We will use `async/await` for all asynchronous code. Inter-service communication will be handled via a message queue (AWS SQS).
* **Configuration Management:** Configuration will be loaded from environment variables, following the 12-Factor App methodology. Do not commit secrets to the repository.

## 5. Repository Organization and File Structure

**What it is:** Standards for organizing files, directories, and project structure to ensure consistency and good user experience.

**Best Practices:**

* Follow industry conventions for file placement
* Prioritize user expectations - put files where users expect to find them
* Keep the root directory clean and organized
* Group related files together logically

**Example Repository Organization:**

| File Type | Location | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Primary User Scripts** | Root directory | First thing users see; matches industry standards |
| **Installation Scripts** | `/install.sh`, `/setup.sh` | Primary user entry point for system setup |
| **Test Files** | `/tests/` or `/test/` | Clear separation of test code from production |
| **Development Tools** | `/scripts/`, `/tools/`, `/bin/` | Internal tooling separated from user interface |
| **Documentation** | Root + organized subdirs | README.md in root, detailed docs in subdirectories |
| **Configuration** | Project root or `/.config/` | Easily discoverable configuration files |
| **Build Artifacts** | `/dist/`, `/build/`, `/out/` | Standard build output directories |

**File Naming Conventions:**

* Use clear, descriptive names that indicate purpose
* Follow consistent patterns within each directory
* Consider alphabetical sorting for better discoverability
* Use standard extensions and prefixes where appropriate

**User Experience Principles:**

* **Intuitive Discovery**: Users should find files where they expect them
* **Clean Root Directory**: Minimize clutter in repository root  
* **Logical Grouping**: Related files grouped together
* **Standard Conventions**: Follow widely-adopted industry patterns

## 6. Data Management

**What it is:** A description of how data is stored, managed, and accessed.

**Best Practices:**

* Include a high-level Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the core data models.
* Specify the database schema migration strategy.

**Example:**

* **High-Level Schema:** `[Insert or link to an ERD of the core models like Users, Products, Orders]`
* **Database Migrations:** Schema changes must be managed through `node-pg-migrate`. All migrations must be reversible.
* **Data Seeding:** The repository will include scripts to seed the database with test data for development environments.

---

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

**What it is:** A plan for handling concerns that affect all parts of the system.

**Example:**

* **Logging:** All services will log structured JSON to `stdout`. Log levels will be configurable via environment variables.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Authentication will be handled by the central `Auth Service` which issues JWTs. Authorization logic within each service will be handled by middleware that inspects the JWT scope.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Key health metrics (e.g., latency, error rate) will be exported to AWS CloudWatch. Alerts will be configured in PagerDuty for critical failures.

---

## 8. User & Developer Experience Patterns

**What it is:** Document your approaches to user interface design and developer workflow - information that can be learned and suggested for future projects.

**Simple Documentation:**

* **User Experience Approach:** How do users interact with your system? (CLI patterns, error messages, help systems)
* **Developer Experience Approach:** How do developers contribute? (setup process, testing approach, code review patterns)  
* **Quality Approach:** What quality standards and tools do you use? (linting, testing frameworks, validation)
* **Maintenance Approach:** How do you handle updates and evolution? (versioning strategy, backward compatibility)

**Example:**
* User Experience: CLI with `--help` for all commands, structured error messages with suggestions
* Developer Experience: Standard GitHub flow, PR templates, automated testing
* Quality: ESLint + Prettier, 80% test coverage requirement, automated security scanning
* Maintenance: Semantic versioning, deprecation warnings before breaking changes

*Note: This information helps the SDD system learn patterns for suggesting defaults in future projects.*

## 9. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) (Optional, but highly recommended)

**What it is:** A collection of short documents, each describing a single, significant architectural decision. This creates a historical record of *why* the architecture is the way it is.

**Best Practices:**

* Use a simple template for each ADR (e.g., Context, Decision, Consequences).
* Store ADRs in a dedicated directory within the repository (e.g., `docs/adr/`).

**Example ADR-001: Choosing PostgreSQL over MongoDB**
> `[Link to docs/adr/001-postgresql-over-mongodb.md]`

# The Specification Hierarchy: From Vision to Task

This document outlines the hierarchy of specifications required for the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) model. The goal is to create a cascading set of documents where each level provides the necessary context for the one below it, ensuring that high-level strategic goals are translated accurately into granular, actionable tasks.

This structure serves as the "single source of truth" for both human architects and AI agents.

---

## 1. The Project Vision (`Project_Vision.md`)

* **Purpose:** The "North Star." This is the highest-level document that answers the question, "Why are we building this?" It's for aligning everyone—from stakeholders to the AI agents—on the core purpose.
* **Contents:**
  * **Mission Statement:** A concise, one-sentence explanation of the project's purpose.
  * **Problem Statement:** A clear description of the pain point or opportunity the project addresses.
  * **Target Audience/User Personas:** Who are we building this for? (e.g., "Enterprise developers," "Small business owners").
  * **High-Level Goals:** What are the ultimate business or strategic outcomes? (e.g., "Capture 10% of the market," "Reduce manual data entry by 90%").

---

## 2. Product Requirements Document (`Product_Requirements.md`)

* **Purpose:** The "What." This document translates the vision into tangible product features and constraints. It defines what the system must do.
* **Contents:**
  * **Functional Requirements:** High-level features and user stories. (e.g., "As a user, I can reset my password.")
  * **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** The critical "ilities" that define system-wide quality attributes. This is a key input for the `Validator` and `Security` agents.
    * *Performance:* "API endpoints must respond in <200ms."
    * *Security:* "The system must be compliant with SOC 2."
    * *Scalability:* "The system must support 10,000 concurrent users."
    * *Usability:* "A new user should be able to complete onboarding in under 5 minutes."
  * **UI/UX Principles:** For products with an interface, this is crucial.
    * **For GUIs:** Links to wireframes, mockups, or a design system. High-level principles like "The interface must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)."
    * **For APIs/CLIs:** Principles for API design (e.g., "We will follow RESTful principles," "All endpoints will be versioned"). This defines the "user experience" for developers.

## 3. Architectural Specification (`specs/Architecture.md`)

* **Purpose:** The "How." This document outlines the technical strategy and constraints. It's the master blueprint for all technical decisions and a primary source for the `Bundler Agent`.
* **Contents:**
  * **Guiding Principles:** High-level technical philosophy (e.g., "We will use a microservices architecture," "We favor event-driven communication," "Code will be written in Python 3.11+").
  * **Technology Stack:** The approved list of languages, frameworks, databases, and cloud services.
  * **System Diagram:** A visual representation of the system's components and their interactions (e.g., using the C4 model).
  * **Data Models:** High-level definitions of the core data entities and their relationships.
  * **Key Design Patterns:** Descriptions of mandatory patterns (e.g., "All database access must go through a Repository pattern").

## 4. Project Roadmap (`Roadmap.md`)

* **Purpose:** The "When." This document lays out the strategic, phased delivery of the product. It turns the "what" into a high-level timeline.
* **Contents:**
  * **Milestones:** Break the project into large, thematic chunks of work. Each milestone should deliver significant value.
    * **Milestone 1: MVP Launch:** "Deliver the core features necessary to attract early adopters."
    * **Milestone 2: Public API:** "Expose key functionality for third-party integrations."
  * **Feature Sequencing:** A high-level list of the features or epics planned for each milestone.

---

## 5. Milestone Plan (`specs/milestones/M1_MVP_Plan.md`)

* **Purpose:** A detailed, tactical plan for a single milestone from the Roadmap. This is what the `Supervisor Agent` would consume to begin its work.
* **Contents:**
  * **Milestone-Specific Goals:** What does success look like for this specific milestone?
  * **Implementation Plan:** A sequenced, ordered list of the tasks required to complete the milestone's features. This list directly generates the `Task Blueprints`.
  * **Testing Plan:** The specific testing strategy for this milestone. This provides the rules for the `Validator Agent`. (e.g., "All new API endpoints must have >90% unit test coverage," "A full end-to-end test will be run for the user registration flow.").

---

## 6. Task Blueprint (`specs/tasks/TASK-XXX.md`)

* **Purpose:** The "Atomic Unit of Work." This is the final, most granular level, as defined in the `How It Works` document. It's the direct input for the "Assembly Line" and contains everything a single agent needs to

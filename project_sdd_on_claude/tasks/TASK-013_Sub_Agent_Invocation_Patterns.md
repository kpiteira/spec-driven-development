## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement standardized sub-agent invocation patterns using Claude Code's Task tool to ensure clean context isolation, proper coordination, and reliable handoffs between agents in the assembly line workflow.

**Context:** This task establishes the foundation for robust sub-agent coordination that enables the Bundler, Coder, and future Validator agents to operate with clean contexts while maintaining proper workflow integration and state management.

**Goal:** Create standardized sub-agent invocation patterns that ensure context isolation, enable reliable agent coordination, provide proper error handling, and establish the foundation for the complete M2 assembly line workflow.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for sub-agent invocation pattern implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Clean Context Sub-Agent Invocation**
  * **Given:** A workflow stage requiring sub-agent processing
  * **When:** Sub-agent invocation is initiated using Claude Code Task tool
  * **Then:** The sub-agent receives only task-specific context without pollution from previous operations
  * **And:** Agent context includes task blueprint, relevant specifications, and required bundle information
  * **And:** Sub-agent operates with focused context optimized for its specific responsibility
  * **And:** Context isolation prevents cross-agent information leakage and hallucination

* **Behavior 2: Standardized Agent Handoff Protocol**
  * **Given:** Completion of one agent's processing stage
  * **When:** Handoff to the next agent in the assembly line occurs
  * **Then:** Agent outputs are properly structured for consumption by the next agent
  * **And:** Handoff includes status information, generated artifacts, and continuation context
  * **And:** Failed agent operations provide clear error information for recovery or debugging
  * **And:** Handoff protocol maintains workflow state consistency throughout the pipeline

* **Behavior 3: Error Handling and Recovery Patterns**
  * **Given:** A sub-agent operation failure at any stage
  * **When:** Error handling and recovery patterns are executed
  * **Then:** Failures are captured with detailed error context and agent identification
  * **And:** Error recovery options are determined based on failure type and workflow stage
  * **And:** Workflow state is preserved to enable debugging and potential recovery
  * **And:** System integrity is maintained without corrupting other workflow components

* **Behavior 4: Agent Performance and Progress Tracking**
  * **Given:** Active sub-agent operations within the assembly line
  * **When:** Performance and progress tracking is performed
  * **Then:** Agent invocation times, completion status, and resource usage are tracked
  * **And:** Progress information provides visibility into workflow bottlenecks and performance
  * **And:** Tracking data supports optimization and debugging of the assembly line process
  * **And:** Performance metrics guide future workflow improvements and resource allocation

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support sub-agent invocation implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Claude Code Task tool patterns, sub-agent architecture designs, and context isolation techniques. Include patterns for clean agent invocation, handoff protocols, and workflow state management
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure sub-agent invocation practices, context isolation security, and protection against information leakage between agents. Include guidance on sanitizing agent inputs and outputs
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Claude Code Task tool interfaces, sub-agent invocation mechanisms, and workflow coordination patterns. Include examples of agent context preparation, invocation syntax, and result processing

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate context isolation effectiveness, agent handoff reliability, error handling completeness, and performance tracking accuracy
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify sub-agent coordination works correctly with the complete assembly line workflow, maintains context isolation under various scenarios, and provides reliable agent coordination
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Context isolation verification, agent coordination pattern compliance, and validation that sub-agent invocation patterns support scalable and reliable workflow execution

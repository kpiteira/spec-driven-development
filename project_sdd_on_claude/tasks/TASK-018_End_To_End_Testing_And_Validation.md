## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements comprehensive end-to-end testing that validates the complete SDD task execution pipeline, ensuring the integrated system works reliably and meets all milestone success criteria before the M2 milestone is considered complete.

**Context:** This is the final task in Slice 4 and the M2 milestone, providing the comprehensive validation needed to confirm that the complete SDD workflow operates correctly. This testing validates all previous tasks working together as an integrated system.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive end-to-end testing suite that exercises the complete `/task` workflow from task blueprint input through all stages to final git commit, validates error handling and recovery scenarios, and confirms that the system meets all M2 milestone success criteria.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for end-to-end testing and validation implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Complete Workflow Success Path Testing**
  * **Given:** Sample task blueprints from TASK-017 are available
  * **When:** End-to-end tests execute the complete `/task` workflow
  * **Then:** Tests must validate successful execution from blueprint input to git commit for various task types
  * **And:** Tests must verify that each workflow stage (Bundle → Code → Validation → Commit) completes correctly
  * **And:** Tests must confirm that generated code meets all quality standards and architectural requirements
  * **And:** Tests must validate that notifications and status reporting work correctly throughout the workflow

* **Behavior 2: Error Scenario and Recovery Testing**
  * **Given:** Various failure conditions can occur during workflow execution
  * **When:** End-to-end tests simulate failure scenarios
  * **Then:** Tests must validate error detection and appropriate recovery workflow activation
  * **And:** Tests must confirm that system state remains consistent after failures
  * **And:** Tests must verify that debugging information is preserved and accessible
  * **And:** Tests must validate that error notifications provide clear, actionable feedback

* **Behavior 3: Performance and Reliability Validation**
  * **Given:** The workflow must operate reliably under various conditions
  * **When:** Performance and reliability tests are executed
  * **Then:** Tests must validate workflow execution time is within acceptable limits
  * **And:** Tests must confirm workflow reliability across different task blueprint variations
  * **And:** Tests must validate proper resource cleanup and memory management
  * **And:** Tests must verify system stability under concurrent or repeated executions

* **Behavior 4: Milestone Success Criteria Validation**
  * **Given:** M2 milestone has specific success criteria defined in the milestone plan
  * **When:** Comprehensive validation tests are executed
  * **Then:** Tests must validate that all M2 success criteria are met by the implemented system
  * **And:** Tests must confirm that the SDD assembly line pattern operates reliably
  * **And:** Tests must verify that generated code integrates cleanly with existing project structure
  * **And:** Tests must validate that the system demonstrates core SDD value proposition of automated blueprint-to-code transformation

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** End-to-end testing strategies for multi-stage automated workflows, test organization and execution patterns, performance testing approaches for code generation systems, and integration testing patterns for complex agent-based systems
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Security testing considerations for automated code generation workflows, safe testing practices that don't compromise system integrity, secure handling of test data and results, and validation of security controls throughout the workflow pipeline
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Complete SDD workflow implementation from all previous tasks, existing testing infrastructure and patterns, sample task blueprints from TASK-017, testing framework integration approaches, and validation methodologies for automated development systems

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that individual end-to-end test cases are well-designed and comprehensive, validate test coverage across all workflow scenarios and failure modes, and confirm that test execution is reliable and reproducible
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must execute the complete end-to-end test suite to validate system functionality, verify that tests accurately reflect real-world usage scenarios, and confirm that test results provide clear evidence of milestone success criteria achievement
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure the testing approach aligns with SDD quality standards and methodology, verify that test infrastructure is maintainable and extensible for future milestones, and confirm that test results provide confidence for M2 milestone completion and readiness for M3 development

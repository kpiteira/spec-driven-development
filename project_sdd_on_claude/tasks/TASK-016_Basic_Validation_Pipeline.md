## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement a comprehensive basic validation pipeline that performs unit testing, linting, type checking, and basic security scanning to ensure generated code meets quality standards before integration.

**Context:** This task completes Slice 3 by creating the validation infrastructure that enforces quality gates in the assembly line workflow. It establishes the foundation for M3's enhanced validation while providing essential quality assurance for M2.

**Goal:** Create a robust validation pipeline that systematically validates generated code quality, enforces project standards, identifies security issues, and provides clear pass/fail verdicts with actionable feedback for code improvement.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the basic validation pipeline.

* **Behavior 1: Comprehensive Unit Test Validation**
  * **Given:** Generated code with accompanying unit tests
  * **When:** Unit test validation is performed
  * **Then:** All unit tests are executed and results are captured comprehensively
  * **And:** Test failures include detailed error messages, stack traces, and failure context
  * **And:** Test coverage is measured and reported for quality assessment
  * **And:** Unit test validation provides clear pass/fail verdict with specific remediation guidance

* **Behavior 2: Code Quality and Standards Enforcement**
  * **Given:** Generated code requiring quality validation
  * **When:** Linting and code standards checking is performed
  * **Then:** Project-defined linting rules and style standards are enforced systematically
  * **And:** Linting violations are reported with specific location and remediation guidance
  * **And:** Code formatting, style consistency, and project conventions are validated
  * **And:** Quality enforcement provides actionable feedback for code improvement

* **Behavior 3: Type Checking and Interface Validation**
  * **Given:** Generated code with type annotations and interface requirements
  * **When:** Type checking validation is performed
  * **Then:** Type consistency is verified across all generated code and existing integrations
  * **And:** Interface compatibility is validated against existing codebase contracts
  * **And:** Type errors are reported with specific context and suggested corrections
  * **And:** Type validation ensures generated code integrates cleanly with existing systems

* **Behavior 4: Basic Security Scanning and Vulnerability Detection**
  * **Given:** Generated code requiring security validation
  * **When:** Basic security scanning is performed
  * **Then:** Common security vulnerabilities are detected and reported systematically
  * **And:** Security scan includes checks for injection attacks, unsafe operations, and exposed secrets
  * **And:** Security findings include severity assessment and remediation guidance
  * **And:** Security scanning provides clear security posture assessment for generated code

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support validation pipeline implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Validation pipeline architectures, quality gate patterns, and systematic validation strategies. Include guidance on test execution environments, validation sequencing, and result aggregation patterns
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure validation practices, security scanning methodologies, and protection against malicious code during validation. Include guidance on safe test execution and secure validation environments
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Validation tool interfaces, test framework patterns, and quality assessment mechanisms. Include examples of test runners, linting tools, type checkers, and security scanners integration

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate each validation component (unit tests, linting, type checking, security scanning) operates correctly and provides accurate results
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify validation pipeline integrates correctly with the assembly line workflow, provides reliable quality gates, and enables appropriate pass/fail decision making
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Validation pipeline reliability assessment, quality gate effectiveness verification, and confirmation that validation pipeline maintains code quality standards and security requirements

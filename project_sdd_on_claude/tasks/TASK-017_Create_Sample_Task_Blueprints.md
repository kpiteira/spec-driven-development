## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task creates a comprehensive set of sample task blueprints that can be used to test and validate the complete SDD workflow, ensuring the system works reliably across different types of development tasks without requiring manual blueprint creation for testing.

**Context:** This is the fifth task in Slice 4, providing the test scenarios needed to validate the complete workflow implemented in TASK-016. These sample blueprints serve as both testing infrastructure and examples for Human Architects learning to use the SDD system.

**Goal:** Generate a diverse set of well-formed task blueprint files that cover common development scenarios (new features, bug fixes, refactoring, integrations) and can be executed through the complete `/task` workflow to demonstrate system capabilities and identify any remaining issues.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for creating comprehensive sample task blueprints.

* **Behavior 1: Diverse Task Blueprint Coverage**
  * **Given:** The need to test various development scenarios
  * **When:** Sample task blueprints are created
  * **Then:** They must cover new feature development, bug fixes, code refactoring, and integration tasks
  * **And:** Blueprints must follow the exact SDD task blueprint template structure and format
  * **And:** Each blueprint must have realistic Given/When/Then acceptance criteria that can be implemented
  * **And:** Task scenarios must be appropriate for testing the complete SDD workflow without external dependencies

* **Behavior 2: Blueprint Quality and Completeness**
  * **Given:** Each sample task blueprint is created
  * **When:** Blueprints are validated for completeness
  * **Then:** Each must include all required YAML frontmatter fields with appropriate values
  * **And:** Task descriptions must be clear, specific, and implementable by the Coder Agent
  * **And:** Acceptance criteria must be testable and specific enough to generate meaningful unit tests
  * **And:** Context bundle requirements must be realistic and achievable by the Bundler Agent

* **Behavior 3: Testing Scenario Representation**
  * **Given:** The need to validate different workflow paths and failure scenarios
  * **When:** Sample blueprints are designed
  * **Then:** They must include scenarios that test successful workflow execution from start to commit
  * **And:** Some blueprints must be designed to test specific error handling and recovery workflows
  * **And:** Blueprints must cover different complexity levels from simple to moderately complex tasks
  * **And:** Each blueprint must be self-contained and not require external setup or dependencies

* **Behavior 4: Documentation and Example Value**
  * **Given:** Sample blueprints will serve as learning examples
  * **When:** Blueprints are created and organized
  * **Then:** Each must include clear documentation explaining what it demonstrates or tests
  * **And:** Blueprints must be organized logically for easy discovery and usage
  * **And:** Examples must represent realistic development tasks that Human Architects might encounter
  * **And:** Blueprint collection must serve as effective training material for new SDD users

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Task blueprint template specifications and required formats, testing scenario design patterns for workflow validation, sample blueprint organization and categorization strategies, and integration patterns with SDD testing infrastructure
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Security considerations for sample task blueprints, safe testing practices that don't compromise system integrity, secure handling of test scenarios and validation, and protection against malicious or problematic sample tasks
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing task blueprint examples and patterns, SDD task blueprint template structure and requirements, testing framework integration patterns, sample task scenarios from similar development automation systems

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that each sample blueprint follows the correct template format and structure, validate that acceptance criteria are well-formed and testable, and confirm that blueprint metadata is complete and appropriate
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test sample blueprints through the complete SDD workflow to ensure they execute successfully, verify that blueprints provide adequate testing coverage for different workflow scenarios, and validate that error-testing blueprints properly exercise recovery workflows
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure sample blueprints align with SDD methodology and template standards, verify that the blueprint collection provides comprehensive testing coverage for the M2 milestone capabilities, and confirm that samples serve as effective documentation and training materials

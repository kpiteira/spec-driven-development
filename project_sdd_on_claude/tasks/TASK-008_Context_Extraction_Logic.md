## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements the core logic within the Bundler Agent for extracting relevant context from the project's architecture specifications and existing codebase. It builds upon TASK-007's sub-agent foundation by adding the intelligence needed to create comprehensive context bundles.

**Context:** This is the second task in Slice 2, following the creation of the Bundler Agent structure. The context extraction logic is the heart of the Bundler Agent's capability, determining what information gets included in context bundles and directly impacting the quality of code generation.

**Goal:** Implement sophisticated context extraction algorithms that can parse architecture specifications, identify relevant code patterns, discover interface definitions, and compile this information into actionable context files for the Coder Agent.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the context extraction logic implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Architecture Rules Extraction**
  * **Given:** A project has architecture specifications in `specs/2_Architecture.md`
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent processes a task blueprint
  * **Then:** It must extract relevant architectural constraints and patterns applicable to the task
  * **And:** It must create `bundle_architecture.md` with specific, actionable architectural guidance
  * **And:** It must filter architecture content to include only rules relevant to the current task context
  * **And:** Extracted rules must be complete enough to guide implementation decisions

* **Behavior 2: Code Pattern Discovery**
  * **Given:** A task blueprint specifies functionality similar to existing code
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent performs semantic search using Serena MCP
  * **Then:** It must identify similar implementations and established patterns in the codebase
  * **And:** It must extract coding conventions, error handling patterns, and integration approaches
  * **And:** It must provide concrete examples of how similar functionality has been implemented
  * **And:** Pattern discovery must avoid including irrelevant or outdated code examples

* **Behavior 3: Interface Discovery and Documentation**
  * **Given:** A task requires interaction with existing code interfaces
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent analyzes the codebase using bash commands and file analysis
  * **Then:** It must extract exact function signatures, method definitions, and API contracts
  * **And:** It must create `bundle_code_context.md` with precise interface documentation
  * **And:** It must include parameter types, return values, and usage examples where available
  * **And:** Interface documentation must be accurate and prevent API hallucination during code generation

* **Behavior 4: Context Quality and Completeness Validation**
  * **Given:** The context extraction process has completed
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent validates the extracted context
  * **Then:** It must verify that context bundles contain sufficient information for implementation
  * **And:** It must check that all task blueprint requirements have corresponding context coverage
  * **And:** It must validate that extracted code interfaces are syntactically correct and accessible
  * **And:** It must report any gaps or missing context that could impact code generation quality

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Semantic search techniques for extracting relevant architectural content, pattern matching algorithms for identifying similar code implementations, and context filtering strategies for task-specific relevance
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure file parsing practices for extracting code interfaces, input validation for processing architecture specifications, and safe handling of dynamic content extraction from arbitrary codebases
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing context extraction patterns from similar systems, Serena MCP usage patterns for semantic code search, file system traversal patterns for interface discovery, and examples of effective context bundle formats

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify context extraction algorithms produce accurate, relevant context for sample task blueprints, test interface discovery against known codebase interfaces, and validate architecture rule filtering for task-specific relevance
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete context bundle creation process from task blueprint input to bundle output files, verify context quality enables successful code generation in downstream agents, and validate error handling for missing or malformed architecture specifications
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure context extraction follows project coding standards, verify integration with Serena MCP and bash command execution patterns, and confirm that context bundle formats match SDD system specifications

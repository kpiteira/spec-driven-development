## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements the core logic within the Bundler Agent for extracting relevant context from the project's architecture specifications and existing codebase. It builds upon TASK-007's sub-agent foundation by adding sophisticated semantic analysis capabilities using Serena MCP tools.

**Context:** This is the second task in Slice 2, following the creation of the Bundler Agent structure. The context extraction logic is the heart of the Bundler Agent's capability, determining what information gets included in context bundles and directly impacting the quality of code generation through semantic code understanding rather than basic text matching.

**Goal:** Implement advanced context extraction algorithms that leverage Serena MCP's semantic analysis tools to parse architecture specifications, identify relevant code patterns through symbol analysis, discover interface definitions with precise semantics, and compile this information into actionable context files for the Coder Agent.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the enhanced context extraction logic implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Architecture Rules Extraction with Semantic Analysis**
  * **Given:** A project has architecture specifications in `specs/2_Architecture.md`
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent processes a task blueprint
  * **Then:** It must extract relevant architectural constraints and patterns applicable to the task using `search_for_pattern` to find architecture-specific guidance
  * **And:** It must create `bundle_architecture.md` with specific, actionable architectural guidance filtered by task requirements
  * **And:** It must use semantic pattern matching rather than simple text search to identify relevant rules
  * **And:** Extracted rules must be complete enough to guide implementation decisions with concrete examples

* **Behavior 2: Semantic Code Pattern Discovery**
  * **Given:** A task blueprint specifies functionality similar to existing code
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent performs semantic analysis using Serena MCP tools
  * **Then:** It must use `find_symbol` with `substring_matching=true` to identify similar implementations in the codebase
  * **And:** It must use `get_symbols_overview` to understand file structure before detailed analysis
  * **And:** It must extract coding conventions, error handling patterns, and integration approaches through `find_referencing_symbols`
  * **And:** It must provide concrete examples with precise file locations and symbol definitions
  * **And:** Pattern discovery must leverage semantic understanding of code relationships, not just text matching

* **Behavior 3: Precise Interface Discovery and Documentation**
  * **Given:** A task requires interaction with existing code interfaces
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent analyzes the codebase using Serena MCP semantic analysis
  * **Then:** It must use `find_symbol` with `include_body=true` to extract exact function signatures and method definitions
  * **And:** It must use `find_referencing_symbols` to understand how interfaces are used throughout the codebase
  * **And:** It must create `bundle_code_context.md` with precise interface documentation including parameter types and return values
  * **And:** Interface documentation must include usage patterns discovered through semantic analysis
  * **And:** Interface discovery must prevent API hallucination through grounded symbol analysis

* **Behavior 4: Enhanced Context Quality and Completeness Validation**
  * **Given:** The semantic context extraction process has completed
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent validates the extracted context using Serena MCP verification
  * **Then:** It must verify that context bundles contain sufficient semantic information for implementation
  * **And:** It must use `search_for_pattern` to validate that all task blueprint requirements have corresponding context coverage
  * **And:** It must validate that extracted code interfaces are semantically correct and accessible through symbol verification
  * **And:** It must report any gaps or missing context that could impact code generation quality with specific semantic analysis

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Serena MCP tool usage patterns for semantic architecture analysis, advanced pattern matching algorithms using `search_for_pattern` and `find_symbol`, context filtering strategies for task-specific relevance using semantic understanding, and integration patterns for combining multiple MCP tool results
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure semantic analysis practices using Serena MCP tools, input validation for processing symbol queries and search patterns, safe handling of dynamic semantic content extraction from codebases, and security considerations for automated code analysis at scale
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing context extraction patterns enhanced with Serena MCP semantic analysis, comprehensive usage examples of `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, and `search_for_pattern` tools, file system traversal patterns combined with semantic symbol discovery, and examples of effective context bundle formats using semantic information

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify enhanced semantic context extraction algorithms produce accurate, relevant context for sample task blueprints using Serena MCP tools, test semantic interface discovery against known codebase interfaces with symbol verification, and validate architecture rule filtering for task-specific relevance using semantic pattern matching
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete enhanced context bundle creation process from task blueprint input to semantic bundle output files, verify context quality enables successful code generation in downstream agents through semantic grounding, and validate error handling for missing or malformed architecture specifications with semantic analysis fallbacks
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure enhanced context extraction follows project coding standards while leveraging Serena MCP capabilities, verify integration with semantic analysis tools and bash command execution patterns, and confirm that semantic context bundle formats match SDD system specifications with enhanced semantic information

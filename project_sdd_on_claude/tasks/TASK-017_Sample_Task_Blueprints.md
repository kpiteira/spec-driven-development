## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Create a comprehensive set of sample task blueprints specifically designed to test and validate the M2 assembly line workflow, covering various complexity levels and implementation scenarios without requiring manual creation dependencies.

**Context:** This task provides the testing foundation for the complete M2 workflow by creating representative task blueprints that cover different types of implementations, edge cases, and validation scenarios needed to prove the assembly line functionality.

**Goal:** Generate diverse, high-quality sample task blueprints that enable comprehensive testing of the task execution pipeline, validate all workflow components, and provide examples that demonstrate the SDD methodology effectiveness.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for sample task blueprint creation.

* **Behavior 1: Diverse Task Blueprint Coverage**
  * **Given:** Requirements for comprehensive workflow testing
  * **When:** Sample task blueprints are generated
  * **Then:** Blueprints cover simple implementations, complex integrations, and edge cases
  * **And:** Sample tasks include different programming paradigms, frameworks, and architectural patterns
  * **And:** Blueprint complexity ranges from basic functions to multi-component integrations
  * **And:** Generated blueprints represent realistic development scenarios without artificial simplification

* **Behavior 2: SDD Template Compliance and Quality**
  * **Given:** Sample task blueprints requiring SDD methodology compliance
  * **When:** Blueprint validation is performed
  * **Then:** All sample blueprints follow exact SDD Task Blueprint template structure
  * **And:** Acceptance criteria are written in proper Given/When/Then format with testable requirements
  * **And:** Context Bundle manifests are realistic and accurately specify required context
  * **And:** Blueprint quality enables successful implementation by the Coder Agent

* **Behavior 3: Assembly Line Testing Scenarios**
  * **Given:** Sample blueprints designed for workflow testing
  * **When:** Blueprints are used in assembly line testing
  * **Then:** Sample tasks test Bundler Agent context generation capabilities comprehensively
  * **And:** Tasks validate Coder Agent implementation across different complexity levels
  * **And:** Blueprints test validation pipeline with various code patterns and quality scenarios
  * **And:** Sample tasks enable end-to-end workflow validation and performance assessment

* **Behavior 4: Self-Contained Implementation Requirements**
  * **Given:** Sample blueprints for independent testing
  * **When:** Blueprint implementation is attempted
  * **Then:** All sample tasks can be implemented using existing project context and patterns
  * **And:** No sample blueprint requires external dependencies or manual setup beyond project scope
  * **And:** Blueprint requirements are achievable within the established project architecture
  * **And:** Sample tasks demonstrate realistic SDD workflow value without artificial constraints

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support sample blueprint creation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** SDD Task Blueprint template specifications, quality standards for task blueprints, and testing scenario patterns. Include guidance on blueprint complexity levels, acceptance criteria writing, and context requirements
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure blueprint creation practices, validation of sample task requirements, and protection against malicious or problematic test scenarios. Include guidance on realistic but safe testing scenarios
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Task Blueprint template interfaces, quality assessment patterns, and blueprint generation mechanisms. Include examples of high-quality blueprints and testing scenario development

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate blueprint template compliance, acceptance criteria quality, context requirement accuracy, and overall blueprint implementability
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify sample blueprints enable comprehensive assembly line testing, cover appropriate complexity ranges, and demonstrate workflow effectiveness
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Blueprint quality assessment, SDD template compliance verification, and confirmation that sample tasks provide comprehensive testing coverage for the M2 assembly line workflow

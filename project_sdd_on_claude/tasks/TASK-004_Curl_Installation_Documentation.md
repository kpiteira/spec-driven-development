## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Create a curl-based installation option that enables one-command SDD system setup and develop comprehensive documentation that guides users through installation, first usage, and troubleshooting.

**Goal:** Provide multiple installation paths (git clone + local script, or direct curl installation) with complete documentation that enables developers to quickly adopt and successfully use the SDD system.

**Context:** This completes the installation system by providing a frictionless installation experience and comprehensive guidance. Good documentation is critical for adoption and demonstrates the SDD principle of handling mechanics while users focus on their strategic work.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the curl installation option and documentation system.

* **Behavior 1: Curl Installation Option**
  * **Given:** A user wants to install SDD without cloning the repository
  * **When:** They execute a curl command (e.g., `curl -sSL url/install.sh | bash`)
  * **Then:** The installation must download and execute the same setup logic as the git clone approach
  * **And:** Templates must be installed to `~/.sdd/templates/` and commands to `.claude/commands/`
  * **And:** Installation verification must confirm successful setup
  * **And:** The process must be secure and transparent about what it's installing

* **Behavior 2: Installation Method Documentation**
  * **Given:** Users need clear installation guidance
  * **When:** They access SDD documentation
  * **Then:** Both installation methods (git clone and curl) must be clearly documented
  * **And:** Prerequisites, system requirements, and dependencies must be specified
  * **And:** Step-by-step instructions must be provided with expected outputs
  * **And:** Verification steps must be included to confirm successful installation

* **Behavior 3: Getting Started Guide**
  * **Given:** Users have successfully installed the SDD system
  * **When:** They want to use it for the first time
  * **Then:** Documentation must guide them through first project initialization
  * **And:** Examples must demonstrate both `/init_greenfield` and `/plan_milestone` workflows
  * **And:** Expected outputs and conversation flows must be illustrated
  * **And:** Common workflow patterns must be documented

* **Behavior 4: Troubleshooting and Support Documentation**
  * **Given:** Users encounter issues during installation or usage
  * **When:** They consult troubleshooting documentation
  * **Then:** Common installation problems must be documented with solutions
  * **And:** Permission issues, path problems, and command discovery issues must be covered
  * **And:** Validation commands must be provided to diagnose installation problems
  * **And:** Clear guidance for getting help or reporting issues must be included

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** This section serves as a manifest for the context files that will be provided by the Bundler and Security Consultant agents.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Contains documentation standards, installation architecture patterns, and distribution mechanisms from the SDD system specification.
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Contains security guidance for curl-based installation, script distribution security, and safe installation practices for users.
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Contains implementation details for:
  * **Curl Installation Patterns:** Best practices for secure, transparent curl-based installation scripts
  * **Documentation Structure:** Effective technical documentation organization, user journey mapping, and support content patterns
  * **User Onboarding:** Techniques for guiding users through first-time usage and building confidence with new tools

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for the Validator Agent on how to verify this task's completion.

* **Curl Installation Testing:** Tests must verify that curl installation works correctly across different environments and produces identical results to git clone installation.
* **Documentation Quality Assessment:** Documentation must be tested with new users to ensure clarity, completeness, and effectiveness.
* **End-to-End Workflow Validation:** Complete installation → first project setup → milestone planning workflow must be validated and documented.
* **Support Content Validation:** Troubleshooting documentation must be tested against real installation issues and common user problems.

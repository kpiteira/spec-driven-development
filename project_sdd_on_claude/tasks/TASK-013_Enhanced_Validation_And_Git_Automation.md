## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements comprehensive validation logic that ensures generated code meets all quality standards before being committed to the codebase. It establishes the quality gates that enforce SDD's commitment to only committing validated, working code.

**Context:** This is the first task in Slice 4, beginning the implementation of the final stage of the assembly line workflow. This validation system is critical to SDD's value proposition of generating production-ready code with confidence.

**Goal:** Implement enhanced validation processes including unit test execution, linting, type checking, and basic security scanning, along with automated git commit functionality that only triggers when all validation passes, ensuring the integrity and quality of the SDD workflow output.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the enhanced validation and git automation implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Comprehensive Test Execution and Validation**
  * **Given:** The Coder Agent has generated implementation code and tests
  * **When:** The validation phase executes
  * **Then:** It must run all generated unit tests and verify they pass
  * **And:** It must execute existing project tests to ensure no regressions were introduced
  * **And:** It must verify test coverage meets project standards for the changed code
  * **And:** Test execution must provide detailed feedback on failures with specific error locations

* **Behavior 2: Static Analysis and Quality Checking**
  * **Given:** Generated code is ready for validation
  * **When:** Static analysis tools are executed
  * **Then:** It must run project linting tools and verify code meets style standards
  * **And:** It must perform type checking (if applicable to the project language) and ensure type safety
  * **And:** It must execute basic security scanning to identify common vulnerabilities
  * **And:** All static analysis must provide specific feedback on violations with remediation guidance

* **Behavior 3: Conditional Git Commit Automation**
  * **Given:** All validation checks have passed successfully
  * **When:** The validation phase completes
  * **Then:** It must automatically create a git commit with the generated changes
  * **And:** It must generate an appropriate commit message following SDD conventions
  * **And:** The commit must include all generated code, tests, and related artifacts
  * **And:** Commit automation must respect existing git workflow and branch policies

* **Behavior 4: Validation Failure Handling and Debugging**
  * **Given:** Any validation check fails during the process
  * **When:** A failure is detected
  * **Then:** The system must halt the workflow and preserve the task bundle for debugging
  * **And:** It must provide detailed, actionable feedback on the specific validation failures
  * **And:** It must categorize failures (test, lint, type, security) to guide remediation efforts
  * **And:** Failed validation must not modify the git repository or affect the working directory state

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Project-specific validation tool configurations, quality gate definitions and thresholds, git workflow patterns and commit message conventions, and integration patterns for validation tools in the project ecosystem
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Security scanning tool selection and configuration, secure handling of validation results and error outputs, git commit security considerations and safe automation practices, and security-focused validation criteria
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing project validation scripts and quality tools, git automation patterns and commit workflow examples, validation error handling and reporting mechanisms, and integration interfaces for test runners and analysis tools

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test each validation component (test execution, linting, type checking, security scanning) independently, verify git commit automation triggers only on successful validation, and validate error handling and reporting for each failure scenario
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete validation workflow from generated code through all quality checks to git commit, verify integration with project-specific validation tools and configurations, and test failure scenarios preserve debugging information without corrupting repository state
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure validation logic follows SDD quality gate specifications, verify compatibility with project development workflows and tooling, and confirm that validation provides sufficient feedback for debugging and continuous improvement of the code generation process

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements sophisticated error recovery workflows that handle common failure scenarios in the SDD assembly line, ensuring that failures leave the system in a recoverable state and provide clear guidance for resolution. This enables robust, production-ready automation.

**Context:** This is the third task in Slice 4, building upon the validation and notification systems from TASK-013 and TASK-014. Error recovery is critical to making the SDD system reliable and usable in real development scenarios where failures are inevitable.

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive error recovery workflows that can automatically resolve some failures, preserve debugging information for others, and provide clear guidance to Human Architects for manual intervention, ensuring the system maintains integrity and usability even when components fail.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for error recovery workflow implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Validation Failure Recovery**
  * **Given:** Enhanced validation detects test failures, linting violations, type errors, or security issues
  * **When:** Validation failures are encountered
  * **Then:** The system must preserve the task bundle with all generated code and validation results
  * **And:** It must provide specific, actionable remediation guidance based on the failure type
  * **And:** It must categorize failures by severity and suggest appropriate recovery strategies
  * **And:** Task bundle must remain accessible for debugging and manual correction

* **Behavior 2: Build and Compilation Error Recovery**
  * **Given:** Generated code has compilation errors or build failures
  * **When:** Build errors are detected during validation
  * **Then:** The system must capture complete build output and error diagnostics
  * **And:** It must identify potential causes (missing dependencies, syntax errors, interface mismatches)
  * **And:** It must suggest specific fixes based on error analysis and project context
  * **And:** Build artifacts and error information must be preserved for debugging

* **Behavior 3: Context and Bundle Creation Error Recovery**
  * **Given:** Bundler Agent fails to create complete context or Coder Agent fails to process bundles
  * **When:** Context creation or processing errors occur
  * **Then:** The system must identify the specific failure point in the context creation process
  * **And:** It must preserve partial context bundles for analysis and debugging
  * **And:** It must provide guidance on missing context, invalid blueprints, or processing failures
  * **And:** Recovery workflow must enable retrying with corrected inputs or manual context supplementation

* **Behavior 4: System State Recovery and Cleanup**
  * **Given:** Any failure occurs during task execution
  * **When:** Error recovery workflows are triggered
  * **Then:** The system must ensure the working directory and git repository remain in a clean, consistent state
  * **And:** It must clean up temporary files and resources that are no longer needed
  * **And:** It must preserve only the information necessary for debugging and recovery
  * **And:** System must be ready for subsequent task executions without requiring manual cleanup

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Error recovery patterns and strategies for multi-stage workflows, system state management and cleanup patterns, debugging and diagnostic information preservation strategies, and recovery workflow integration with notification systems
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure handling of error information and diagnostic data, safe cleanup procedures that don't expose sensitive information, secure preservation of debugging artifacts, and protection against error-based system exploitation
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing error handling patterns in the SDD system, validation error processing and categorization examples, system cleanup and state management interfaces, diagnostic information collection and preservation patterns

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test each error recovery scenario independently (validation failures, build errors, context issues), verify state cleanup and preservation of debugging information, and validate recovery guidance accuracy and actionability
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test error recovery workflows integrated with the complete task execution pipeline, verify system state consistency after various failure and recovery scenarios, and test error recovery integration with notification systems
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure error recovery follows SDD reliability requirements (NFR-REL-002), verify recovery workflows maintain system integrity and debugging capability, and confirm that error handling enhances rather than complicates the development workflow

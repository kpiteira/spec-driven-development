## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement specific error recovery workflows for common failure scenarios in the task execution pipeline, ensuring system resilience and enabling Human Architects to recover from failures efficiently.

**Context:** This task creates systematic recovery mechanisms for predictable failure modes in the assembly line workflow, including validation failures, build errors, context issues, and agent coordination problems, maintaining system integrity while enabling recovery.

**Goal:** Create comprehensive error recovery workflows that handle common failure scenarios gracefully, preserve system state for debugging, provide clear recovery guidance, and maintain workflow reliability despite individual component failures.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for error recovery workflow implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Validation Failure Recovery**
  * **Given:** A task execution that fails during validation stage (tests, linting, type checking)
  * **When:** Validation failure recovery workflow is triggered
  * **Then:** The system preserves all validation outputs and error details for debugging
  * **And:** Recovery options are presented: retry after fixes, rollback, or manual intervention
  * **And:** Task bundle is preserved with validation artifacts for troubleshooting
  * **And:** Validation failure doesn't corrupt workspace or affect subsequent tasks

* **Behavior 2: Build and Compilation Error Recovery**
  * **Given:** A task execution that fails during build or compilation
  * **When:** Build error recovery workflow is triggered
  * **Then:** Build outputs, compiler errors, and build context are captured and preserved
  * **And:** Recovery workflow identifies common build issues and suggests fixes
  * **And:** Partial build artifacts are cleaned up safely without affecting working code
  * **And:** Build error context is sufficient for Human Architect intervention and debugging

* **Behavior 3: Context Bundle and Agent Failure Recovery**
  * **Given:** Failures in context bundle generation, agent invocation, or agent processing
  * **When:** Agent failure recovery workflow is triggered
  * **Then:** Agent failure context is captured including stage, inputs, and error details
  * **And:** Recovery options include agent retry, context adjustment, or manual bundle creation
  * **And:** Failed agent state is isolated to prevent contamination of subsequent operations
  * **And:** Agent failure recovery maintains task bundle integrity for alternative approaches

* **Behavior 4: System State Recovery and Cleanup**
  * **Given:** Any workflow failure that leaves the system in an inconsistent state
  * **When:** System state recovery is performed
  * **Then:** All partial operations are either completed or cleanly rolled back
  * **And:** System workspace is restored to a consistent, recoverable state
  * **And:** Recovery process preserves debugging information and failure context
  * **And:** System state recovery enables continued operation without manual cleanup

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support error recovery implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Error recovery patterns, failure isolation techniques, and system resilience architectures. Include patterns for atomic operations, rollback mechanisms, and state recovery procedures
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure error recovery practices, safe cleanup procedures, and protection against recovery-induced vulnerabilities. Include guidance on secure state rollback and error information sanitization
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Error handling interfaces, recovery workflow patterns, and failure detection mechanisms. Include examples of error capture, recovery procedures, and state management for failure scenarios

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate recovery workflow effectiveness for each failure type, state preservation accuracy, and recovery procedure reliability
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify error recovery works correctly within the complete assembly line workflow, maintains system integrity during failures, and enables successful recovery across various failure scenarios
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Recovery workflow reliability validation, failure isolation verification, and confirmation that error recovery maintains system resilience and enables productive failure handling

## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements agent self-introspection capability that enables Claude Code agents to collect and analyze data about their own planning and execution processes, identifying patterns of confusion, errors, and inefficiencies for process improvement.

**Context:** This is the first task in Slice 5, building upon the complete autonomous milestone execution system to add learning and improvement capabilities. This enables Claude Code agents to become self-aware of their performance and contribute to process evolution.

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive agent self-introspection that enables Claude Code agents to collect data about their planning and execution experiences, analyze patterns of confusion and inefficiencies, and generate insights for process improvement throughout milestone planning and execution workflows.

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task enables continuous improvement of the SDD system by allowing Claude Code agents to identify and analyze their own performance patterns, contributing to better milestone planning and execution through self-aware learning.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: Complete milestone execution infrastructure from Slices 1-4, autonomous execution capabilities
- **Enables**: TASK-029 (Retrospective analysis), TASK-030 (Learning integration)
- **Parallel OK**: None (introspection foundation is required for retrospective analysis)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: Complete milestone execution infrastructure, autonomous execution patterns, existing logging and state management from previous slices
- **Creates**: Agent self-introspection system, performance pattern analysis, confusion and error detection
- **Modifies**: Milestone and task execution workflows to include introspection data collection

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Implement self-monitoring capabilities that track agent decision-making, confusion points, and performance patterns throughout execution
- **Key Files**: Agent introspection utilities, performance analysis tools, self-monitoring integration with existing workflows
- **Complexity**: Level 5 (requires sophisticated self-awareness and pattern analysis capabilities)
- **Time Estimate**: 9 hours (introspection system + pattern analysis + confusion detection + integration + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for agent self-introspection capability.

* **Behavior 1: Comprehensive Self-Monitoring Data Collection**
  * **Given:** Claude Code agents are executing milestone planning or execution processes
  * **When:** Agents encounter decision points, confusion, errors, or inefficiencies
  * **Then:** The system must collect detailed introspection data about agent experience including decision-making patterns, uncertainty points, error scenarios, and performance metrics
  * **And:** Self-monitoring must capture data without disrupting normal agent operation or workflow performance
  * **And:** Introspection data collection must be comprehensive enough to support meaningful pattern analysis
  * **And:** Data collection must distinguish between different types of agent experiences (confusion, errors, inefficiencies, successful decisions)

* **Behavior 2: Pattern Analysis and Issue Identification**
  * **Given:** Self-introspection data has been collected across agent operations
  * **When:** Pattern analysis is performed on the collected data
  * **Then:** The system must identify patterns of confusion, errors, and inefficiencies that agents experienced
  * **And:** Pattern analysis must distinguish between systematic issues (affecting process design) and isolated incidents (individual circumstances)
  * **And:** Issue identification must categorize problems by type, frequency, and impact on agent performance
  * **And:** Pattern analysis must generate specific insights about where and why agents struggled during planning and execution

* **Behavior 3: Self-Performance Evaluation and Insight Generation**
  * **Given:** Pattern analysis has identified agent performance issues and patterns
  * **When:** Self-evaluation processing generates insights
  * **Then:** The system must generate specific insights about agent performance including strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities
  * **And:** Self-evaluation must identify specific process elements that caused confusion or inefficiency for agents
  * **And:** Insight generation must provide actionable recommendations for process improvement based on agent experience
  * **And:** Performance evaluation must be objective and focused on process improvement rather than agent judgment

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Milestone and Task Execution Workflows**
  * **Given:** Agent self-introspection is active during milestone and task execution
  * **When:** Normal SDD workflows are executing
  * **Then:** Introspection must integrate seamlessly without disrupting autonomous execution or performance
  * **And:** Self-monitoring must capture relevant data across all phases of milestone execution (planning, task execution, completion)
  * **And:** Integration must provide introspection data that supports the retrospective analysis requirements for TASK-029
  * **And:** Workflow integration must maintain system performance and reliability while adding introspection capability

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Self-introspection patterns for AI agent systems, performance monitoring and analysis strategies, integration with milestone and task execution workflows, learning and improvement system architectures
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure self-introspection data handling, protection against introspection data manipulation, privacy considerations for agent performance data, validation of self-monitoring systems
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing milestone and task execution workflow interfaces, performance monitoring and logging infrastructure, pattern analysis and insight generation utilities, integration points for self-introspection capabilities

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test self-monitoring data collection accuracy and completeness, verify pattern analysis correctly identifies agent performance issues, validate self-performance evaluation generates meaningful and actionable insights, and confirm integration with existing workflows doesn't disrupt performance
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete self-introspection capability across full milestone planning and execution scenarios, verify introspection data supports effective retrospective analysis, test self-monitoring integration with autonomous execution and all existing infrastructure, and confirm introspection insights provide valuable input for process improvement
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure self-introspection follows SDD principles for learning and continuous improvement, verify that introspection capabilities maintain system performance and reliability, confirm that agent self-awareness provides genuine value for process evolution, and validate that introspection data supports the comprehensive retrospective requirements for subsequent tasks

## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements milestone state cleanup and completion handling that manages milestone bundle lifecycle, performs appropriate cleanup after successful completion, and maintains milestone execution history.

**Context:** This is the third and final task in Slice 3, building upon TASK-022's state tracking and TASK-023's resume logic to complete the state management lifecycle. This ensures that milestone execution has proper completion handling and maintains system cleanliness.

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive milestone state cleanup and completion handling that manages milestone bundle lifecycle appropriately, performs cleanup after successful execution, and maintains execution history while preventing state accumulation that could affect system performance.

---

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task ensures proper milestone execution lifecycle management by providing appropriate cleanup and completion handling, preventing state accumulation while preserving necessary execution history for analysis and debugging.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: TASK-022 (Milestone state tracking), TASK-023 (Resume logic)
- **Enables**: TASK-025 (Autonomous execution), clean foundation for milestone execution workflows
- **Parallel OK**: None (cleanup logic depends on complete state management foundation)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: TASK-022 milestone state tracking, TASK-023 resume logic, existing bundle cleanup patterns from M2-M3
- **Creates**: Milestone completion handling system, state cleanup orchestration, execution history management
- **Modifies**: Milestone execution workflow to include proper completion and cleanup phases

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Implement intelligent cleanup logic that preserves necessary history while removing temporary state, integrate with existing bundle cleanup patterns
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md` (enhance existing), cleanup utilities, completion handling logic
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (requires careful balance between cleanup and history preservation)
- **Time Estimate**: 5 hours (completion handling + cleanup logic + history management + edge cases + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for milestone state cleanup and completion.

* **Behavior 1: Milestone Completion Detection and Handling**
  * **Given:** All tasks in a milestone have completed successfully
  * **When:** The final task in the milestone execution completes
  * **Then:** The system must detect milestone completion and initiate completion handling workflow
  * **And:** Milestone completion must be clearly marked in the milestone bundle with completion timestamp
  * **And:** Completion handling must verify that all tasks have indeed completed successfully
  * **And:** The system must provide clear milestone completion confirmation to the Human Architect

* **Behavior 2: Intelligent State Cleanup After Successful Completion**
  * **Given:** A milestone has completed successfully
  * **When:** Cleanup processing is triggered
  * **Then:** The system must perform intelligent cleanup of temporary milestone state
  * **And:** Task bundle directories for completed tasks must be cleaned up appropriately (following existing patterns)
  * **And:** Temporary milestone execution state must be removed while preserving completion history
  * **And:** Cleanup must not remove information needed for retrospective analysis or debugging

* **Behavior 3: Execution History Preservation and Management**
  * **Given:** Milestone completion and cleanup are processing
  * **When:** State cleanup determines what to preserve vs remove
  * **Then:** The system must preserve milestone execution history including completion summary, task execution timeline, and any significant events
  * **And:** Execution history must be stored in a format accessible for future analysis and retrospectives
  * **And:** History preservation must include sufficient detail for debugging and process improvement
  * **And:** History management must prevent excessive accumulation while maintaining useful information

* **Behavior 4: Cleanup Failure Handling and Partial Milestone Scenarios**
  * **Given:** Milestone execution ends with failures or partial completion
  * **When:** Cleanup processing evaluates the milestone state
  * **Then:** The system must handle partial milestone scenarios without removing debugging information
  * **And:** Failed or interrupted milestones must preserve state for resume capability
  * **And:** Cleanup must be safe for partial states and not corrupt resume information
  * **And:** Clear distinction must be maintained between completed milestones (cleanup eligible) and partial milestones (preserve for resume)

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** State cleanup patterns for milestone workflows, completion handling strategies, execution history management approaches, integration with existing bundle cleanup patterns from M2-M3
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure cleanup practices, protection against information leakage during cleanup, safe handling of execution history, validation of cleanup operations
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing bundle cleanup patterns from task system, milestone state management interfaces from TASK-022, completion detection logic, history preservation utilities

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test milestone completion detection accuracy, verify intelligent cleanup logic preserves necessary information while removing temporary state, validate execution history preservation and management, and confirm cleanup failure handling and partial milestone scenarios
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete milestone lifecycle from execution through completion and cleanup, verify cleanup integration with existing bundle management patterns, test cleanup behavior across different milestone completion scenarios (success, failure, interruption), and confirm cleanup supports retrospective analysis requirements
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure cleanup logic follows SDD patterns for state management and history preservation, verify that cleanup maintains system performance and doesn't accumulate unnecessary state, confirm that completion handling supports the autonomous execution requirements for subsequent tasks, and validate that cleanup provides appropriate balance between cleanliness and debugging capability

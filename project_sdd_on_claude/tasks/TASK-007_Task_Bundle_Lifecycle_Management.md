## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement comprehensive lifecycle management for task bundles, including state transitions, progress tracking, error handling, and atomic operations that maintain system integrity throughout the assembly line workflow.

**Context:** This task builds on the basic bundle structure to create dynamic lifecycle management that tracks bundles through the complete assembly line: Created → Bundling → Coding → Validating → Completed/Failed. It ensures proper state management and recovery capabilities.

**Goal:** Create a robust bundle lifecycle system that tracks state transitions, manages concurrent operations safely, provides debugging information for failures, and maintains atomic consistency throughout the task execution workflow.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for task bundle lifecycle management.

* **Behavior 1: Bundle State Transition Management**
  * **Given:** A task bundle in "created" state
  * **When:** The bundle progresses through the assembly line workflow
  * **Then:** Bundle status transitions properly: created → bundling → coding → validating → completed
  * **And:** Each state transition is recorded with timestamp and responsible agent
  * **And:** Invalid state transitions are rejected with clear error messages
  * **And:** Bundle status can be queried at any time for progress tracking

* **Behavior 2: Atomic Operation Guarantees**
  * **Given:** A bundle operation in progress (state transition, file updates)
  * **When:** The operation completes or fails
  * **Then:** The bundle is left in a consistent, valid state
  * **And:** Partial operations are either completed or fully rolled back
  * **And:** No bundle artifacts are left in corrupted or indeterminate state
  * **And:** Concurrent operations are properly synchronized to prevent conflicts

* **Behavior 3: Error Handling and Recovery**
  * **Given:** A bundle operation failure at any lifecycle stage
  * **When:** The error handling system processes the failure
  * **Then:** Bundle state is updated to "failed" with detailed error information
  * **And:** Error context includes stage, agent, timestamp, and specific failure reason
  * **And:** Bundle artifacts are preserved for debugging and potential recovery
  * **And:** System remains stable and ready for subsequent operations

* **Behavior 4: Bundle Progress Tracking and Reporting**
  * **Given:** One or more bundles in various lifecycle states
  * **When:** Bundle status is queried or reported
  * **Then:** Current state, progress, and timing information is accurately reported
  * **And:** Bundle history shows complete state transition log
  * **And:** Progress information is sufficient for user feedback and debugging
  * **And:** Status queries are efficient and don't interfere with ongoing operations

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support bundle lifecycle implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** State machine patterns for bundle lifecycle, atomic operation designs, and concurrency control patterns. Include architectural requirements for state persistence, recovery mechanisms, and progress tracking systems
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure state management, atomic filesystem operations, and safe error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information. Include guidance on preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** State management interfaces, YAML handling for bundle status, file locking mechanisms, and error recovery patterns. Include examples of atomic operations and state transition implementations

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate state transitions, atomic operations, error handling, concurrent access patterns, and state query mechanisms
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify lifecycle management works correctly with the complete assembly line workflow, handles multiple simultaneous bundles, and provides accurate progress reporting
* **Project-Wide Checks:** State consistency validation, atomic operation verification, and testing of error recovery mechanisms under various failure scenarios

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Integrate all M2 components into a complete, reliable task execution workflow that processes task blueprints through the full assembly line: Task Command → Bundler → Coder → Validation → Git Commit, with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.

**Context:** This task represents the culmination of M2 by bringing together all slice components into a seamless, production-ready workflow that demonstrates the SDD methodology's core value proposition of automated task blueprint execution.

**Goal:** Create a fully integrated task execution workflow that reliably transforms task blueprints into committed, working code through systematic agent coordination, quality validation, and comprehensive error handling.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for complete workflow integration.

* **Behavior 1: End-to-End Task Execution Success Path**
  * **Given:** A valid task blueprint and properly configured project environment
  * **When:** `/task TASK-XXX` command is executed
  * **Then:** Complete assembly line workflow executes: Command → Bundle → Context Generation → Code Generation → Validation → Git Commit
  * **And:** Each workflow stage completes successfully with proper handoffs to subsequent stages
  * **And:** Generated code passes all validation gates and integrates cleanly with existing codebase
  * **And:** Successful execution results in committed code and clean workspace with comprehensive completion notification

* **Behavior 2: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery**
  * **Given:** Various failure scenarios at different workflow stages
  * **When:** Workflow failures occur during execution
  * **Then:** Failures are detected immediately with specific error context and recovery guidance
  * **And:** Error recovery workflows execute appropriate cleanup and preservation procedures
  * **And:** Failed task bundles are preserved with complete debugging information
  * **And:** System maintains integrity and readiness for subsequent task execution

* **Behavior 3: Quality Gate Enforcement and Validation Integration**
  * **Given:** Generated code requiring quality validation
  * **When:** Validation pipeline executes within the workflow
  * **Then:** All quality gates (unit tests, linting, type checking, security scanning) execute systematically
  * **And:** Quality failures prevent code commitment with clear feedback on specific issues
  * **And:** Quality validation provides actionable remediation guidance for code improvement
  * **And:** Quality gate enforcement maintains project standards without exception

* **Behavior 4: User Experience and Workflow Transparency**
  * **Given:** Human Architects executing tasks through the workflow
  * **When:** Workflow operations provide user feedback and progress reporting
  * **Then:** Progress updates are clear, timely, and informative about current workflow stage
  * **And:** Completion notifications include comprehensive status and outcome information
  * **And:** Error messages provide specific, actionable guidance for issue resolution
  * **And:** Workflow transparency enables effective debugging and optimization

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support workflow integration.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Complete workflow architecture patterns, integration strategies, and end-to-end coordination mechanisms. Include guidance on workflow orchestration, error handling integration, and user experience patterns
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure workflow integration practices, end-to-end security validation, and protection throughout the complete assembly line process. Include guidance on secure handoffs and comprehensive security assurance
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Workflow integration interfaces, orchestration patterns, and end-to-end coordination mechanisms. Include examples of complete workflow implementation, error handling integration, and user feedback systems

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate workflow stage integration, error handling completeness, quality gate enforcement, and user experience components
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify complete end-to-end workflow operates reliably across various task types, handles all failure scenarios appropriately, and provides consistent user experience
* **Project-Wide Checks:** End-to-end workflow validation, assembly line reliability assessment, and confirmation that integrated workflow achieves M2 milestone goals and demonstrates SDD methodology effectiveness

## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task adds basic milestone progress notifications to the `/milestone` command by integrating with the existing hook infrastructure to send notifications for milestone start and completion events.

**Context:** This is the first task in Milestone 5's "Basic Milestone Notifications" slice. It leverages the existing hook system established in earlier milestones to provide automated progress reporting for milestone-level events. This enhances the user experience by keeping Human Architects informed of milestone execution status without requiring manual monitoring.

**Goal:** Integrate milestone start and completion notifications into the `/milestone` command using the existing hook infrastructure, providing automated status updates that inform Human Architects when milestones begin and finish execution.

---

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task enables automated milestone progress tracking through REQ-004 enhancement, providing Human Architects with essential visibility into autonomous milestone execution status.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: Existing hook infrastructure, M4 `/milestone` command functionality
- **Enables**: TASK-034 (Individual task completion notifications), comprehensive milestone status reporting
- **Parallel OK**: TASK-032 (resume capability) - both enhance different aspects of milestone execution

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: Existing hook system and notification infrastructure, current `/milestone` command implementation, established notification patterns
- **Creates**: Milestone-level notification integration, start and completion event triggers
- **Modifies**: Milestone command workflow to include notification hooks

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Integrate hook calls into existing milestone command workflow at start and completion points
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md`, existing hook system integration points
- **Complexity**: Level 2 (straightforward integration with existing infrastructure)
- **Time Estimate**: 4 hours (hook integration + notification formatting + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for milestone notification integration.

* **Behavior 1: Milestone Start Notification**
  * **Given:** A milestone execution is initiated via `/milestone [name]` command
  * **When:** The milestone command begins processing the milestone plan
  * **Then:** A milestone start notification must be sent through the existing hook system
  * **And:** The notification must include milestone name and basic execution context
  * **And:** Notification sending must not delay or interfere with milestone execution

* **Behavior 2: Milestone Completion Notification**
  * **Given:** A milestone execution completes successfully (all tasks finished)
  * **When:** The milestone command finishes processing all tasks in the sequence
  * **Then:** A milestone completion notification must be sent through the existing hook system
  * **And:** The completion notification must include milestone name, task count, and success status
  * **And:** Completion notification must be sent regardless of whether milestone was resumed or executed from start

* **Behavior 3: Hook Infrastructure Integration**
  * **Given:** The existing hook system is operational
  * **When:** Milestone notifications are triggered
  * **Then:** Notifications must use the established hook infrastructure and patterns
  * **And:** Notification format must be consistent with existing SDD notification standards
  * **And:** Hook integration must not introduce new dependencies or complexity

* **Behavior 4: Notification Content Standards**
  * **Given:** Milestone start or completion events occur
  * **When:** Notifications are generated
  * **Then:** Notification content must include milestone identifier, event type, and timestamp
  * **And:** Content must be concise and actionable for Human Architects
  * **And:** Notifications must be distinguishable from individual task notifications

---

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Existing hook system architecture and integration patterns, current `/milestone` command implementation, notification infrastructure standards, milestone execution workflow points for hook integration
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure notification practices, protection against notification spam or abuse, validation of hook system integration, safe handling of milestone context in notifications
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing hook system interfaces and usage patterns, milestone command implementation details, notification formatting standards, hook integration examples from previous tasks

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test milestone start notification triggering, verify milestone completion notification generation, validate hook system integration without execution interference, and confirm notification content format and accuracy
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test notifications with complete milestone executions, verify notification behavior with resumed milestone executions, test hook system integration across different milestone plans, and confirm compatibility with existing notification infrastructure
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure milestone notifications follow existing hook system patterns, verify notification content meets SDD standards for clarity and usefulness, confirm integration maintains milestone execution performance, and validate that notifications align with NFR-UX-001 user experience requirements

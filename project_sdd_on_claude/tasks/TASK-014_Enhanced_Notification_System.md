## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement an enhanced notification system using Claude Code hooks to provide Human Architects with sound alerts and detailed status information about task completion, failures, and workflow progress.

**Context:** This task creates the feedback mechanism that enables Human Architects to monitor the assembly line workflow without constant polling, providing immediate notification of completion status, errors requiring intervention, and progress updates.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive notification system that provides sound alerts, detailed status reporting, and actionable information to Human Architects, enabling efficient monitoring and intervention capabilities for the task execution workflow.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the enhanced notification system.

* **Behavior 1: Sound Alert Configuration and Delivery**
  * **Given:** A task execution workflow with notification requirements
  * **When:** Significant workflow events occur (completion, failure, progress milestones)
  * **Then:** Appropriate sound alerts are triggered through Claude Code hooks
  * **And:** Sound alerts are differentiated by event type (success, warning, error)
  * **And:** Alert volume and frequency are configurable and reasonable for work environments
  * **And:** Sound alerts work consistently across different operating systems and Claude Code configurations

* **Behavior 2: Detailed Status and Progress Reporting**
  * **Given:** Active task execution workflows
  * **When:** Status reporting is triggered by workflow events or user request
  * **Then:** Detailed status information includes current stage, progress, timing, and completion estimates
  * **And:** Progress reports identify which agents are active, completed, or failed
  * **And:** Status information is clear, actionable, and sufficient for decision-making
  * **And:** Reports include context about task requirements and implementation progress

* **Behavior 3: Error and Intervention Notifications**
  * **Given:** Workflow failures, errors, or conditions requiring human intervention
  * **When:** Error notification is triggered
  * **Then:** Notification includes specific error details, failure location, and remediation guidance
  * **And:** Error alerts are prioritized appropriately with urgent sound alerts for critical failures
  * **And:** Intervention notifications provide clear action items and troubleshooting steps
  * **And:** Error context includes sufficient information for debugging and resolution

* **Behavior 4: Notification Persistence and History**
  * **Given:** Multiple workflow executions and notification events over time
  * **When:** Notification history and persistence is accessed
  * **Then:** Notification history provides chronological view of workflow events and outcomes
  * **And:** Critical notifications are persisted for later review and analysis
  * **And:** History includes sufficient detail for workflow optimization and troubleshooting
  * **And:** Notification data supports performance analysis and process improvement

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support notification system implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Claude Code hooks patterns, notification architectures, and sound alert implementation strategies. Include guidance on hook integration, event-driven notification patterns, and cross-platform sound alert mechanisms
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure notification handling, protection against notification spam, and safe sound alert implementations. Include guidance on preventing notification-based attacks and ensuring appropriate alert levels
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Claude Code hooks interfaces, sound alert APIs, notification formatting patterns, and event handling mechanisms. Include examples of hook implementation, sound alert integration, and notification persistence

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate sound alert functionality, notification formatting, event handling accuracy, and persistence mechanisms
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify notification system works correctly with the complete assembly line workflow, provides timely and accurate alerts, and integrates seamlessly with Claude Code hooks
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Notification system reliability validation, sound alert functionality verification across platforms, and confirmation that notifications enhance Human Architect productivity and workflow monitoring

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements an enhanced notification system that provides Human Architects with clear, immediate feedback about task completion status through Claude Code's hooks system, including sound notifications for key events to enable efficient workflow monitoring.

**Context:** This is the second task in Slice 4, building upon the validation system from TASK-013. The notification system is essential for providing visibility into the automated workflow, allowing Human Architects to monitor progress and intervene when necessary without constant polling.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive notification system using Claude Code hooks that provides real-time feedback on task execution progress, completion status, and failure conditions, with sound alerts for key events to ensure Human Architects stay informed of workflow status.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the enhanced notification system implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Hook Integration and Event Tracking**
  * **Given:** The `/task` command workflow executes various stages
  * **When:** Key workflow events occur (start, completion, failure)
  * **Then:** The system must trigger appropriate hooks with structured event data
  * **And:** Hooks must be configured in `.claude/hooks/` with proper event handling
  * **And:** Event data must include task ID, stage, status, timestamp, and relevant context
  * **And:** Hook execution must not interfere with or slow down the main workflow

* **Behavior 2: Sound Notification Implementation**
  * **Given:** Critical workflow events occur (task success, task failure, validation errors)
  * **When:** Notification hooks are triggered
  * **Then:** The system must play distinct sound alerts for different event types
  * **And:** Sound notifications must be configurable and can be disabled if desired
  * **And:** Different sounds must clearly distinguish between success, failure, and warning events
  * **And:** Sound playback must work across different operating systems where Claude Code runs

* **Behavior 3: Status Reporting and Progress Feedback**
  * **Given:** Long-running task operations are in progress
  * **When:** Each stage of the assembly line workflow completes
  * **Then:** The system must provide clear status updates indicating current progress
  * **And:** Updates must include stage names, completion status, and estimated remaining work
  * **And:** Status information must be available for Human Architects to check workflow progress
  * **And:** Progress reporting must handle both successful progression and error conditions

* **Behavior 4: Failure Notification and Debugging Information**
  * **Given:** Task execution encounters failures at any stage
  * **When:** Failures are detected and reported
  * **Then:** The notification system must provide detailed failure information including stage, error type, and context
  * **And:** Failure notifications must include actionable guidance for debugging and resolution
  * **And:** Critical failures must trigger immediate sound alerts to ensure prompt attention
  * **And:** Failure information must be logged and accessible for later review and analysis

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Claude Code hooks system architecture and configuration patterns, event-driven notification design patterns, sound notification implementation approaches for cross-platform compatibility, and integration patterns with workflow orchestration
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure handling of notification data and event information, privacy considerations for workflow status reporting, secure sound file handling and playback, and protection against notification system exploitation or abuse
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Claude Code hooks configuration examples and patterns, sound notification libraries and cross-platform audio playback, event handling and status tracking interfaces, notification system integration with existing workflow components

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test hook configuration and event triggering for various workflow scenarios, verify sound notification playback for different event types, and validate status reporting accuracy and completeness across workflow stages
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete notification system integration with the full task workflow, verify cross-platform compatibility of sound notifications, and test notification system performance impact on workflow execution speed
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure notification system follows Claude Code hooks specifications, verify integration with SDD workflow orchestration patterns, and confirm that notifications enhance rather than disrupt the Human Architect experience with configurable options

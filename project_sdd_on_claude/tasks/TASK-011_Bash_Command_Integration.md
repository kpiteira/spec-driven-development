## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement bash command integration within the Bundler Agent to perform local codebase analysis, file system operations, and discovery tasks that complement semantic search capabilities.

**Context:** This task enhances the Bundler Agent with system-level analysis capabilities using bash commands for file discovery, grep operations, directory analysis, and other local operations that provide comprehensive codebase understanding alongside semantic search.

**Goal:** Create robust bash command integration that enables systematic local codebase analysis, file discovery, and pattern matching while maintaining security and reliability within the Bundler Agent workflow.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for bash command integration.

* **Behavior 1: Secure Bash Command Execution**
  * **Given:** A Bundler Agent task requiring local file system analysis
  * **When:** Bash commands are executed for codebase analysis
  * **Then:** Commands execute safely with appropriate security constraints
  * **And:** Command execution is sandboxed to prevent system damage
  * **And:** Command outputs are captured and processed correctly
  * **And:** Execution failures are handled gracefully without stopping the workflow

* **Behavior 2: File Discovery and Pattern Matching**
  * **Given:** Task requirements specifying types of files or patterns to find
  * **When:** Bash-based file discovery is performed
  * **Then:** The system uses appropriate commands (find, grep, ls) to locate relevant files
  * **And:** File patterns, extensions, and directory structures are identified accurately
  * **And:** Search results are filtered and prioritized based on task relevance
  * **And:** Discovery includes both exact matches and related file types

* **Behavior 3: Code Analysis and Extraction**
  * **Given:** Located files requiring content analysis
  * **When:** Bash commands analyze file contents
  * **Then:** The system extracts relevant code snippets, function definitions, and patterns
  * **And:** It identifies imports, dependencies, and structural relationships
  * **And:** Content analysis complements semantic search with systematic examination
  * **And:** Extracted information is structured for context bundle integration

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Bundle Generation**
  * **Given:** Bash analysis results and other context sources
  * **When:** Context bundle generation integrates bash findings
  * **Then:** Bundle content includes discoveries from file system analysis
  * **And:** Bash results enhance and validate semantic search findings
  * **And:** Combined analysis provides comprehensive codebase understanding
  * **And:** Integration maintains context bundle quality and structure standards

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support bash command integration.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Secure command execution patterns, file system analysis strategies, and bash integration architectures. Include guidance on command sandboxing, result processing, and integration with other analysis methods
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure bash command execution, input validation for commands, and protection against command injection attacks. Include guidelines for safe file system access and command parameter sanitization
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Bash command execution interfaces, file system operation patterns, and command result processing mechanisms. Include examples of safe command construction, output parsing, and error handling

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate secure command execution, file discovery accuracy, content analysis quality, and integration with existing Bundler Agent functionality
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify bash integration enhances context bundle completeness, works reliably across different project structures, and integrates seamlessly with semantic search capabilities
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Security validation for command execution, bash integration safety verification, and confirmation that combined analysis methods improve context bundle quality and code generation accuracy

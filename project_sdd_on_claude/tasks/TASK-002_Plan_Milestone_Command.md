## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Create the `.claude/commands/plan_milestone.md` file that contains a comprehensive conversation prompt to guide architects through transforming roadmap goals into detailed, executable milestone plans with vertical slices and task sequences.

**Goal:** Build a structured conversation workflow that takes high-level roadmap milestones and breaks them down into actionable, well-structured milestone plans following SDD methodology and template structure.

**Context:** This is the core deliverable of Slice 2 and the command we'll use to test our own methodology by planning M2, M3, M4, and M5. The conversation must be sophisticated enough to analyze roadmap intent and systematic enough to produce consistent, executable milestone plans.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the `/plan_milestone` command file and conversation workflow.

* **Behavior 1: Proper Command Structure**
  * **Given:** The command file is created as `.claude/commands/plan_milestone.md`
  * **When:** Claude Code scans for available commands
  * **Then:** The command must be discoverable with proper parameter handling
  * **And:** Frontmatter must include `model: opus`, clear description, `argument-hint: "[milestone-name]"`, and minimal allowed-tools
  * **And:** The command must comply with `REQ-CMD-001` frontmatter requirements
  * **And:** The command must accept a milestone identifier as a parameter

* **Behavior 2: Roadmap Analysis and Goal Definition**
  * **Given:** A user executes `/plan_milestone "M2-Core-Execution"` with existing project roadmap
  * **When:** The conversation workflow runs
  * **Then:** The system must analyze the existing roadmap to understand the specified milestone
  * **And:** The conversation must guide definition of specific milestone goals and success criteria
  * **And:** Goals must be measurable and aligned with overall project vision and requirements
  * **And:** Success criteria must be specific enough to determine milestone completion

* **Behavior 3: Vertical Slice Breakdown**
  * **Given:** Defined milestone goals and requirements scope
  * **When:** The planning conversation continues
  * **Then:** The system must guide breaking work into logical vertical slices
  * **And:** Each vertical slice must deliver demonstrable, end-to-end value
  * **And:** Slices must build logically toward milestone goals
  * **And:** Each slice must have clear acceptance criteria and task sequences
  * **And:** Tasks within each slice must be atomic and properly sequenced

* **Behavior 4: Complete Milestone Plan Generation**
  * **Given:** The conversation completes milestone planning
  * **When:** The milestone plan document is generated
  * **Then:** A complete `Milestone_Plan.md` file must be created following SDD template structure
  * **And:** The document must include goals, scope, vertical slices, testing plan, and definition of done
  * **And:** All vertical slices must have detailed task sequences with proper task identifiers
  * **And:** The plan must be actionable and ready for execution by future milestone commands

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** This section serves as a manifest for the context files that will be provided by the Bundler and Security Consultant agents.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Contains SDD milestone planning methodology, vertical slice principles, and task breakdown patterns from the Architecture specification.
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Contains security guidance for milestone planning conversations, parameter validation, and secure file handling patterns.
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Contains implementation details for:
  * **Milestone Template Structure:** Complete milestone plan template with required sections, vertical slice format, and task sequence patterns
  * **Roadmap Analysis Techniques:** Methods for analyzing existing roadmaps and extracting milestone-specific requirements
  * **Vertical Slice Design:** Principles for breaking work into valuable, demonstrable increments with proper task sequencing

---

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for the Validator Agent on how to verify this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must verify command file structure, parameter handling, frontmatter compliance, and that the command is recognized by Claude Code.
* **Integration Test Scope:** Tests must verify that executing `/plan_milestone "Test-Milestone"` produces a valid milestone plan document that follows SDD template structure and contains actionable vertical slices.
* **Conversation Quality Test Scope:** Tests must verify that the conversation workflow analyzes roadmaps effectively, guides strategic milestone breakdown, and produces executable plans rather than generic templates.
* **Self-Validation Test:** The command must be capable of planning subsequent SDD milestones (M2, M3, M4, M5) as proof of methodology effectiveness.

## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task integrates milestone execution with the existing hook system to provide sound notifications and enhanced observability for milestone-level events during autonomous execution.

**Context:** This is the second task in Slice 4, building upon TASK-025's autonomous execution logic to add notification integration. This ensures that Human Architects receive appropriate feedback about milestone progress even during hands-off autonomous execution.

**Goal:** Integrate milestone execution with the existing hook system to provide sound notifications for milestone-level events, enhance observability for autonomous execution, and maintain consistency with existing SDD notification patterns from M2-M3.

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task ensures that autonomous milestone execution provides appropriate feedback and observability to Human Architects through the established notification infrastructure, maintaining awareness during hands-off operation.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: TASK-025 (Autonomous execution logic), existing hook system from M2-M3
- **Enables**: TASK-027 (Completion reporting), enhanced milestone observability
- **Parallel OK**: None (hook integration must work with autonomous execution patterns)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: TASK-025 autonomous execution infrastructure, existing hook system from M2-M3, established notification patterns
- **Creates**: Milestone-level hook integration, autonomous execution notification orchestration
- **Modifies**: Milestone execution workflow to include appropriate hook triggers, extends existing hook system for milestone events

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Integrate with existing hook system using established patterns, implement milestone-level event triggers without disrupting autonomous flow
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md` (enhance existing), hook integration utilities, milestone event definitions
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (integration with existing system using established patterns)
- **Time Estimate**: 5 hours (hook integration + event definition + notification orchestration + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for hook system integration.

* **Behavior 1: Milestone-Level Event Notification Integration**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing with autonomous operation
  * **When:** Significant milestone events occur (start, progress milestones, completion, failure)
  * **Then:** The system must trigger appropriate milestone-level notifications through the existing hook system
  * **And:** Milestone notifications must be distinct from individual task notifications
  * **And:** Hook integration must provide sound notifications for milestone start, significant progress, and completion
  * **And:** Notification triggers must not disrupt autonomous execution flow

* **Behavior 2: Sound Notification for Autonomous Execution Events**
  * **Given:** Milestone execution is running autonomously
  * **When:** Milestone-level events require Human Architect awareness
  * **Then:** The system must provide sound notifications using the existing hook system infrastructure
  * **And:** Sound notifications must be appropriate for the event type (different sounds for start, progress, completion, failure)
  * **And:** Notifications must be delivered without requiring Human Architect interaction to continue execution
  * **And:** Sound notifications must integrate seamlessly with existing notification patterns from M2-M3

* **Behavior 3: Enhanced Observability for Milestone Progress**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing with hook system integration
  * **When:** Milestone progress events occur (task completions, slice completions, significant milestones)
  * **Then:** The system must provide enhanced observability through the hook system
  * **And:** Progress notifications must include relevant milestone context and status information
  * **And:** Observability enhancements must support Human Architect monitoring without disrupting autonomous operation
  * **And:** Hook integration must provide consistent information with existing progress reporting from TASK-021

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Existing Hook System Patterns**
  * **Given:** Milestone execution requires hook system integration
  * **When:** Hook events are triggered during milestone execution
  * **Then:** The system must follow existing hook system patterns and conventions from M2-M3
  * **And:** Milestone hook integration must be consistent with existing task-level hook patterns
  * **And:** Hook system integration must not interfere with existing task notifications
  * **And:** Milestone hooks must extend the existing system without breaking existing functionality

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Hook system architecture and integration patterns from M2-M3, milestone event definition strategies, notification orchestration for autonomous execution, existing notification and observability infrastructure
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure hook system integration, protection against notification manipulation, validation of hook triggers and events, safe integration with autonomous execution patterns
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing hook system implementation details from M2-M3, notification patterns and interfaces, milestone execution event points, sound notification and observability utilities

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test milestone-level hook integration triggers and events, verify sound notification generation for different milestone event types, validate integration with existing hook system patterns and conventions, and confirm hook integration doesn't disrupt autonomous execution flow
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete milestone execution with hook system integration across various scenarios, verify hook notifications provide appropriate observability for autonomous execution, test integration with existing task-level notifications and hook patterns, and confirm enhanced observability supports effective Human Architect monitoring
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure hook system integration follows established SDD notification patterns, verify that milestone hooks extend existing infrastructure without breaking functionality, confirm that autonomous execution observability provides valuable Human Architect awareness, and validate that hook integration maintains system performance and reliability

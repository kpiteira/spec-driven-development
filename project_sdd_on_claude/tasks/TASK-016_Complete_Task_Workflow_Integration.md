## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task integrates all components developed in previous tasks into a complete, end-to-end `/task` workflow, creating the full SDD assembly line that transforms task blueprints into committed, tested code through automated agent coordination.

**Context:** This is the fourth task in Slice 4, bringing together the Bundler Agent (Slice 2), Coder Agent (Slice 3), validation system, notification system, and error recovery workflows into a single, cohesive automated workflow. This represents the core value proposition of the SDD system.

**Goal:** Create a complete `/task TASK-ID` workflow that orchestrates Bundler → Coder → Validation → Notification → Commit/Recovery in a reliable, observable, and maintainable way, providing the Human Architect with a single command that transforms specifications into production code.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the complete task workflow integration.

* **Behavior 1: End-to-End Assembly Line Orchestration**
  * **Given:** A valid task blueprint exists in the project tasks directory
  * **When:** `/task TASK-ID` is executed
  * **Then:** The system must execute the complete workflow: Bundle Creation → Code Generation → Validation → Git Commit
  * **And:** Each stage must complete successfully before proceeding to the next stage
  * **And:** Stage transitions must preserve context and state information for debugging
  * **And:** The complete workflow must provide progress updates and status reporting throughout execution

* **Behavior 2: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery Integration**
  * **Given:** Any stage in the workflow encounters failures
  * **When:** Errors are detected during workflow execution
  * **Then:** The appropriate error recovery workflow must be triggered based on failure type and stage
  * **And:** The system must provide detailed diagnostic information specific to the failure scenario
  * **And:** Failed workflows must preserve debugging information while maintaining system integrity
  * **And:** Error recovery must enable either automated resolution or clear guidance for manual intervention

* **Behavior 3: Success Path with Automated Commit**
  * **Given:** All workflow stages complete successfully
  * **When:** The validation phase passes all quality checks
  * **Then:** The system must automatically create a git commit with all generated changes
  * **And:** The commit message must follow SDD conventions and include relevant task information
  * **And:** The task bundle must be cleaned up after successful commit
  * **And:** Success notifications must be triggered to inform the Human Architect of completion

* **Behavior 4: Workflow State Management and Observability**
  * **Given:** The workflow is executing or has completed
  * **When:** The Human Architect needs to understand workflow status or debug issues
  * **Then:** The system must provide clear visibility into current workflow state and progress
  * **And:** All workflow stages must be logged with timestamps and relevant context information
  * **And:** Failed workflows must preserve sufficient information for debugging and recovery
  * **And:** Workflow execution history must be available for analysis and process improvement

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Complete workflow orchestration patterns for multi-agent systems, state management strategies for complex automated workflows, integration patterns that combine all SDD components, and observability and debugging approaches for assembly line processes
* **`bundle_security.md`:** End-to-end security considerations for automated code generation workflows, secure integration of multiple agents and validation systems, protection against workflow manipulation or exploitation, and safe handling of generated code throughout the entire pipeline
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** All existing task workflow components (Bundler integration, Coder integration, validation system, notification system, error recovery), workflow orchestration interfaces and patterns, complete `/task` command implementation examples, and integration testing approaches for complex workflows

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test workflow orchestration logic for correct stage sequencing and state transitions, verify error handling integration across all workflow stages, and validate state management and cleanup procedures for both success and failure scenarios
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete end-to-end workflow from task blueprint input to git commit output, verify integration of all components (Bundler, Coder, validation, notifications, error recovery), and test various failure and recovery scenarios across different workflow stages
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure the complete workflow meets all SDD requirements for automated task execution, verify performance and reliability under various load and error conditions, and confirm that the workflow provides sufficient observability and debugging capabilities for production use

## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task enhances the milestone command with comprehensive progress reporting that provides detailed milestone status, completion tracking, and visibility into the autonomous execution process.

**Context:** This is the second task in Slice 2, building upon TASK-019's basic milestone execution and TASK-020's error handling to add enhanced visibility into milestone progress. This provides Human Architects with clear understanding of execution status and completion tracking.

**Goal:** Implement enhanced progress reporting for milestone execution that provides detailed status updates after each task completion, tracks overall milestone progress with clear completion indicators, and gives Human Architects comprehensive visibility into the autonomous execution process.

---

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task enables Human Architects to monitor autonomous milestone execution effectively, providing the visibility needed to understand progress and make informed decisions during long-running milestone workflows.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: TASK-019 (Basic milestone command), TASK-020 (Error handling foundation)
- **Enables**: TASK-022 (State tracking builds on progress visibility), all subsequent milestone enhancements
- **Parallel OK**: Can be developed in parallel with state management tasks since it focuses on reporting

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: TASK-019 milestone execution foundation, TASK-020 error handling context, existing Claude Code progress reporting patterns
- **Creates**: Enhanced milestone progress reporting system, detailed completion tracking, milestone status visibility
- **Modifies**: Milestone command progress output, status reporting mechanisms

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Enhance existing milestone command with detailed progress reporting, implement comprehensive status tracking through execution lifecycle
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md` (enhance existing), progress reporting utilities, status tracking mechanisms
- **Complexity**: Level 2 (focused enhancement to existing system with clear reporting requirements)
- **Time Estimate**: 4 hours (progress reporting enhancement + status tracking + completion indicators + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for enhanced milestone progress reporting.

* **Behavior 1: Detailed Task Completion Progress Updates**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing with multiple tasks
  * **When:** Each task completes successfully
  * **Then:** The system must provide clear progress updates after each task completion
  * **And:** Progress updates must include specific task information (e.g., "Completed TASK-001: Create user authentication [1/5]")
  * **And:** Updates must show current progress in context of total tasks (e.g., "[1/5]", "[2/5]")
  * **And:** Task completion status must be clearly communicated with success indicators

* **Behavior 2: Milestone Status and Execution Context**
  * **Given:** A milestone is in progress
  * **When:** Progress reporting is triggered
  * **Then:** The system must display detailed milestone status including milestone name, current vertical slice, and overall progress
  * **And:** Execution context must include estimated remaining time and completed vs remaining tasks
  * **And:** Current task execution details must be provided when a task is in progress
  * **And:** Milestone-level progress must be clearly distinguished from task-level progress

* **Behavior 3: Comprehensive Completion Tracking and Summary**
  * **Given:** Tasks are completing within a milestone execution
  * **When:** The milestone progress is reported
  * **Then:** The system must track and report which specific tasks have completed successfully
  * **And:** Completed tasks must be clearly marked with success indicators and completion timestamps
  * **And:** The system must provide a clear summary of accomplishments at any point during execution
  * **And:** Progress tracking must be preserved and accessible for resume capability

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Existing Notification and Hook Systems**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing with enhanced progress reporting
  * **When:** Significant progress milestones are reached (task completion, slice completion)
  * **Then:** Progress updates must integrate with existing notification systems from M2-M3
  * **And:** Hook system integration must provide progress notifications without disrupting execution flow
  * **And:** Progress reporting must be consistent with existing SDD notification patterns
  * **And:** Enhanced reporting must not interfere with error handling from TASK-020

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Progress reporting patterns for multi-task workflows, milestone status tracking strategies, integration with existing notification systems, visibility and observability best practices for autonomous execution
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure progress information handling, protection against information leakage in progress reports, safe integration with notification systems, validation of progress reporting flows
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing progress reporting patterns from M2-M3 infrastructure, notification system interfaces, hook system integration examples, milestone execution status management patterns

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test detailed progress update generation and formatting, verify milestone status tracking accuracy and completeness, validate completion tracking and summary generation, and confirm integration with notification systems
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test progress reporting throughout complete milestone execution scenarios, verify progress visibility supports Human Architect decision-making, test integration with existing notification and hook systems, and confirm progress reporting works correctly with error handling from TASK-020
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure progress reporting follows SDD conventions for status visibility, verify that enhanced reporting maintains system performance and doesn't disrupt execution flow, confirm that progress tracking supports the resume capability requirements for future tasks, and validate that reporting provides actionable visibility for Human Architects monitoring autonomous execution

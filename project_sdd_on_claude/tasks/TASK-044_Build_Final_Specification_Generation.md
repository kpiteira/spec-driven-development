# Task Blueprint: TASK-044 Build final specification generation with user roadmap input and SDD workflow compatibility

## 1. Task Description

**From Milestone Plan:** This task creates the final specification generation capability that will incorporate all contradiction resolutions, gather additional user roadmap input beyond what was discovered in the repository, and generate final documents that clearly distinguish between current reality and intended direction, enabling milestone planning workflow (following init_greenfield pattern).

*Technical Implementation:* Build final specification generation logic that will synthesize contradiction resolution decisions into complete, consistent specification documents. The final documents follow SDD templates exactly and include special sections that clearly distinguish between "Current State" and "Target State" where relevant. The generation logic processes the living documents with user resolution decisions and creates clean, final versions in `specs/` directory following init_greenfield output pattern.

*Reality vs Intent Distinctions:* Each specification document includes clear markers for areas where current reality differs from intended direction. The Vision document includes "Current State Assessment" and "Strategic Direction" subsections. The Requirements document distinguishes between "Implemented Capabilities" (FR-IMP-XXX) and "Planned Features" (FR-PLN-XXX). The Architecture document separates "Current Implementation Architecture" from "Target Architecture" with explicit migration considerations. The Roadmap document includes specific improvement tasks generated from contradiction resolution with proper task sequencing.

*SDD Workflow Compatibility:* Ensure final specifications enable milestone planning workflow by including proper requirement numbering (FR-XXX, NFR-XXX), clear acceptance criteria, and actionable descriptions. Generate improvement tasks that can be included in future milestone plans. The output exactly matches init_greenfield format: `specs/0_Project_Vision.md`, `specs/1_Product_Requirements.md`, `specs/2_Architecture.md`, `specs/3_Roadmap.md`.

*Quality Validation:* Perform final validation that all four documents follow SDD template structure exactly, maintain consistent cross-references, include all required sections, and provide actionable guidance for milestone planning. Ensure that specifications acknowledge architectural complexity and messy reality rather than creating idealized versions. Validate that improvement tasks in roadmap are specific, measurable, and executable.

*User Roadmap Input Collection:* Before generating final roadmap, prompt user for additional roadmap items beyond what was discovered in the repository: "Based on analysis, I've identified [X] improvement areas from contradictions and technical debt. Are there additional strategic initiatives, features, or improvements you want to include in the roadmap that weren't mentioned in existing docs or inferred from code? [list any additional milestones, technical initiatives, business requirements, etc.]". This ensures the final roadmap reflects both discovered gaps and strategic user input.

*User Confirmation and Handoff:* Present final documents to user for approval: "Final specifications generated. **Vision:** [key points]. **Requirements:** [FR count] implemented, [FR count] planned. **Architecture:** Current [pattern] targeting [pattern]. **Roadmap:** [milestone count] with [improvement task count] plus [user-added count] strategic initiatives. Ready to proceed with milestone planning using these specifications? [Y/n]". Include summary report explaining what was generated and how the specifications reflect both current reality and intended direction.

*Integration Points:* Ensure clean handoff to standard SDD workflow. Final specifications should be immediately usable with `/plan_milestone` command. Include completion confirmation that brownfield discovery and specification generation is complete, and development can proceed following standard SDD methodology.

**Additional Implementation Details:**

The final specification generation capability must implement comprehensive synthesis logic that processes all contradiction resolution decisions from living documents and generates clean, template-compliant SDD specification documents. The generation operates on the principle that agents read and analyze documents through natural language understanding to create final specifications that enable milestone planning workflow.

### Specification Generation Architecture

The generation logic implements systematic processing of resolved contradictions into final documents:

1. **Living Document Processing**: Load all living documents with user resolution decisions from TASK-043 outputs
2. **Synthesis Logic**: Combine resolved contradictions into coherent, consistent specification content
3. **Template Compliance**: Ensure all generated documents follow SDD template structure exactly
4. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Maintain consistent references between all four specification documents
5. **Reality vs Intent Integration**: Systematically distinguish current state from target state throughout all documents

### Document Generation Framework

Each specification document is generated using specific synthesis patterns:

- **Vision Document**: Combine documented intent with code reality insights to create realistic strategic direction
- **Requirements Document**: Merge implemented capabilities with planned features using proper FR-IMP/FR-PLN numbering
- **Architecture Document**: Synthesize current implementation architecture with target architecture and migration path
- **Roadmap Document**: Integrate discovered improvement tasks with user strategic initiatives and proper sequencing

### User Roadmap Input Integration

The roadmap input collection process systematically gathers strategic user input:

1. **Discovered Gap Summary**: Present clear summary of improvement areas identified through contradiction analysis
2. **Strategic Input Request**: Use exact prompt format to gather additional user roadmap items
3. **Input Integration**: Seamlessly merge user strategic initiatives with discovered improvement tasks
4. **Priority Coordination**: Ensure proper sequencing and dependency management for all roadmap items

### Quality Validation Engine

The final validation process ensures specification quality and usability:

- **Template Compliance**: Verify all documents follow SDD template structure exactly with proper frontmatter
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Validate consistent references between documents (FR-XXX, NFR-XXX, milestones)
- **Actionability Assessment**: Ensure all requirements and roadmap items include clear acceptance criteria
- **Reality Acknowledgment**: Confirm specifications reflect architectural complexity without oversimplification

### File Organization and Output

All final specifications follow exact init_greenfield naming patterns:

- `specs/0_Project_Vision.md` - Complete vision document with current state and strategic direction
- `specs/1_Product_Requirements.md` - Requirements with implemented (FR-IMP) and planned (FR-PLN) features
- `specs/2_Architecture.md` - Architecture with current implementation and target patterns
- `specs/3_Roadmap.md` - Roadmap with improvement tasks and user strategic initiatives

### User Confirmation Protocol

The confirmation and handoff process follows structured presentation:

- **Document Summary**: Provide clear overview of each generated specification document
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Present counts of requirements, milestones, improvement tasks, and user additions
- **Readiness Confirmation**: Explicit user confirmation for proceeding with milestone planning workflow
- **Handoff Documentation**: Clear explanation of what was generated and how to proceed with SDD development

## 2. Implementation Guidance

### Generation Logic Integration

The final specification generation capability extends the `/init_brownfield` command by adding synthesis logic that loads living documents with user resolution decisions and generates clean, template-compliant specification documents. The logic must handle complex resolution patterns and maintain consistency across all four documents.

### Synthesis Algorithm Structure

The synthesis algorithm implements structured processing across multiple phases:

1. **Resolution Processing**: Extract user decisions from living documents and conversation state
2. **Content Integration**: Merge resolved contradictions into coherent specification content
3. **Template Application**: Apply SDD template structure to ensure compliance and consistency
4. **Cross-Reference Generation**: Create proper requirement numbering and document references

### User Input Collection Strategy

The roadmap input collection process implements structured user engagement:

- **Context Presentation**: Clear summary of discovered improvement areas from analysis
- **Strategic Prompting**: Use exact prompt format to gather additional user roadmap items
- **Input Validation**: Ensure user additions are specific and actionable for milestone planning
- **Integration Logic**: Seamlessly merge user strategic initiatives with discovered tasks

### Document Generation Process

The specification generation follows systematic patterns for each document type:

1. **Vision Synthesis**: Combine strategic direction with realistic current state assessment
2. **Requirements Integration**: Merge implemented and planned features with proper numbering schemes
3. **Architecture Composition**: Balance current implementation reality with target architecture goals
4. **Roadmap Coordination**: Sequence improvement tasks with user strategic initiatives and dependencies

### Quality Assurance Framework

The validation process implements comprehensive quality checks:

- **Template Verification**: Ensure exact compliance with SDD template structure and required sections
- **Consistency Validation**: Verify cross-references and numbering schemes across all documents
- **Actionability Assessment**: Confirm all requirements and roadmap items enable effective milestone planning
- **Reality Balance**: Validate specifications acknowledge complexity without creating idealized versions

### User Interaction Design

The confirmation and handoff process implements structured user engagement:

- **Summary Presentation**: Clear overview of generated content with quantitative metrics
- **Approval Process**: Explicit user confirmation using specified prompt format
- **Handoff Guidance**: Clear explanation of next steps and SDD workflow readiness
- **Documentation Completion**: Confirmation that brownfield discovery process is complete

### Error Handling Strategy

The generation capability implements robust error handling for real-world scenarios:

- **Missing Resolution Data**: Graceful handling when living documents are incomplete
- **Template Compliance Issues**: Clear error reporting with specific compliance requirements
- **User Input Processing**: Validation and sanitization of additional roadmap items
- **Integration Failures**: Fallback options for manual review and completion

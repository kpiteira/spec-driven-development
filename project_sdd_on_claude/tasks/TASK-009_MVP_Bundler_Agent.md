## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Create the foundational Bundler Agent sub-agent that analyzes local codebase and project specifications to create comprehensive context bundles, focusing on local analysis capabilities while deferring external dependencies to M5.

**Context:** This task implements the first specialized agent in the M2 assembly line. The MVP Bundler establishes the context gathering pattern that prevents AI hallucination by providing accurate, researched context about the codebase, architectural rules, and relevant implementation patterns.

**Goal:** Implement a robust Bundler Agent that creates comprehensive context bundles through local codebase analysis, architectural specification extraction, and systematic context preparation that enables successful code generation without external research dependencies.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the MVP Bundler Agent implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Sub-Agent Context Isolation and Invocation**
  * **Given:** A task bundle with a task blueprint requiring context analysis
  * **When:** The Bundler Agent is invoked via Claude Code Task tool
  * **Then:** The agent operates with clean, focused context including only task-specific information
  * **And:** Agent invocation follows proper Claude Code sub-agent patterns for isolation
  * **And:** The agent reads the task blueprint and understands context requirements
  * **And:** Agent outputs are structured and ready for consumption by downstream agents

* **Behavior 2: Local Codebase Analysis and Pattern Discovery**
  * **Given:** A project codebase and task blueprint specifying implementation needs
  * **When:** Bundler Agent performs local analysis
  * **Then:** It discovers relevant existing code interfaces, patterns, and implementations
  * **And:** It identifies similar implementations that can guide the new task
  * **And:** It extracts exact function signatures, class definitions, and API patterns
  * **And:** Analysis results are comprehensive enough to prevent hallucination in code generation

* **Behavior 3: Architectural Specification Extraction**
  * **Given:** Project architecture specifications and task blueprint requirements
  * **When:** Bundler Agent processes architectural context
  * **Then:** It extracts relevant architectural rules, patterns, and constraints
  * **And:** It identifies technology choices, coding standards, and structural requirements
  * **And:** It creates focused architectural guidance specific to the task requirements
  * **And:** Architectural context is actionable and directly applicable to the implementation

* **Behavior 4: Context Bundle Generation**
  * **Given:** Completed local analysis and architectural extraction
  * **When:** Bundler Agent generates context bundle files
  * **Then:** It creates `bundle_architecture.md` with focused architectural guidance
  * **And:** It creates `bundle_code_context.md` with exact interfaces and implementation examples
  * **And:** Context files are comprehensive, accurate, and sufficient for code generation
  * **And:** Bundle contents are structured for optimal consumption by the Coder Agent

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support Bundler Agent implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Sub-agent implementation patterns for Claude Code, Task tool usage patterns, and context isolation techniques. Include architectural guidance for local codebase analysis, specification parsing, and context bundle generation patterns
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure codebase analysis practices, safe file reading patterns, and protection against malicious code during analysis. Include guidance on safe specification parsing and context sanitization
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Claude Code sub-agent interfaces, Task tool invocation patterns, file system analysis tools, and context generation mechanisms. Include examples of codebase parsing, pattern recognition, and structured output generation

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate sub-agent invocation patterns, local codebase analysis accuracy, architectural extraction completeness, and context bundle generation quality
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify Bundler Agent integrates correctly with task orchestration, produces context bundles consumable by Coder Agent, and operates reliably within the assembly line workflow
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Sub-agent context isolation verification, bundle content quality validation, and confirmation that generated context prevents hallucination and enables accurate code generation

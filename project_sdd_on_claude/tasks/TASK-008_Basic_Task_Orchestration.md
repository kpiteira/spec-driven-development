## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement the basic orchestration logic that coordinates the assembly line workflow, managing the sequence of agent invocations and providing the foundation for the complete M2 task execution pipeline.

**Context:** This task completes Slice 1 by creating the orchestration backbone that will coordinate Bundler, Coder, and Validator agents. It establishes the workflow pattern that transforms task blueprints into working code through systematic agent collaboration.

**Goal:** Create a robust orchestration system that manages the assembly line sequence, handles agent invocations, provides progress feedback, and establishes error handling patterns for the complete task execution workflow.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for basic task orchestration implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Assembly Line Workflow Coordination**
  * **Given:** A task bundle in "created" state and valid orchestration configuration
  * **When:** Task orchestration is initiated
  * **Then:** The workflow progresses through defined stages: Bundle Creation → Agent Preparation → Ready for Bundler
  * **And:** Each stage completion triggers the next stage automatically
  * **And:** Stage transitions are logged with timestamps and status information
  * **And:** The orchestration provides clear feedback about current stage and progress

* **Behavior 2: Agent Invocation Pattern Establishment**
  * **Given:** A workflow stage requiring agent processing
  * **When:** Agent invocation is triggered
  * **Then:** The orchestration prepares clean context for the agent
  * **And:** Agent invocation follows Claude Code Task tool patterns for context isolation
  * **And:** Agent results are captured and processed appropriately
  * **And:** Agent failures are handled gracefully without corrupting the workflow

* **Behavior 3: Workflow State Management and Recovery**
  * **Given:** An orchestration workflow in progress
  * **When:** A stage fails or requires recovery
  * **Then:** The workflow state is preserved with detailed error information
  * **And:** Recovery options are determined based on failure type and stage
  * **And:** Partial workflow state can be resumed or cleanly aborted
  * **And:** System integrity is maintained throughout recovery operations

* **Behavior 4: Progress Reporting and Feedback**
  * **Given:** An active orchestration workflow
  * **When:** Progress information is requested or reported
  * **Then:** Current stage, completion status, and timing information is provided
  * **And:** Progress updates are clear and actionable for human architects
  * **And:** Error information includes specific failure details and remediation guidance
  * **And:** Success completion provides summary information about generated artifacts

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support task orchestration implementation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Orchestration patterns for Claude Code workflows, assembly line design patterns, and agent coordination mechanisms. Include patterns for Task tool usage, context isolation, and workflow state management
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure workflow orchestration, agent context isolation security, and safe handling of intermediate workflow states. Include guidance on preventing information leakage between agents
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Claude Code Task tool interfaces, workflow management patterns, and orchestration implementation examples. Include error handling patterns and agent invocation mechanisms

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate workflow stage transitions, agent invocation patterns, error handling, progress reporting, and recovery mechanisms
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify orchestration works correctly with the task bundle system, provides proper foundation for future agent integration, and maintains workflow integrity under various scenarios
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Workflow consistency validation, orchestration pattern compliance, and verification that the foundation supports the complete M2 assembly line architecture

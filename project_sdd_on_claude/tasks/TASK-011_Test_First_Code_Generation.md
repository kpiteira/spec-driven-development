## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements the core TDD workflow logic within the Coder Agent, creating the sophisticated code generation process that transforms task blueprint contracts into failing tests, then implements code that makes those tests pass while ensuring architectural compliance.

**Context:** This is the second task in Slice 3, building upon the Coder Agent structure created in TASK-010. This task implements the heart of the SDD code generation capability, ensuring that all generated code follows TDD principles and architectural guidance.

**Goal:** Implement the complete test-first code generation workflow including contract-to-test translation, architectural compliance checking, code implementation logic, and integration validation to ensure generated code meets all requirements and quality standards.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the test-first code generation workflow implementation.

* **Behavior 1: Contract-to-Test Translation**
  * **Given:** A task blueprint with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
  * **When:** The Coder Agent processes the task contract
  * **Then:** It must generate unit tests that directly reflect each Given/When/Then behavior
  * **And:** It must create tests that will initially fail (demonstrating TDD red phase)
  * **And:** It must include edge cases and error conditions specified in the contract
  * **And:** Generated tests must be executable and follow project testing framework conventions

* **Behavior 2: Architectural Compliance Validation**
  * **Given:** The task bundle contains `bundle_architecture.md` with architectural rules
  * **When:** The Coder Agent designs the implementation approach
  * **Then:** It must validate that the planned implementation adheres to all architectural constraints
  * **And:** It must use required design patterns, interfaces, and integration approaches
  * **And:** It must respect technology choices, coding standards, and structural requirements
  * **And:** Any architectural compliance violations must be flagged and resolved before code generation

* **Behavior 3: Test-Driven Implementation Generation**
  * **Given:** Failing tests have been created and architectural compliance validated
  * **When:** The Coder Agent implements the production code
  * **Then:** It must generate code that makes all tests pass (TDD green phase)
  * **And:** It must use exact interfaces and signatures from `bundle_code_context.md`
  * **And:** It must integrate cleanly with existing codebase patterns and dependencies
  * **And:** Implementation must be minimal and focused, avoiding over-engineering

* **Behavior 4: Code Quality and Refactoring**
  * **Given:** The implementation makes all tests pass
  * **When:** The Coder Agent performs the refactoring phase (TDD refactor phase)
  * **Then:** It must improve code structure, readability, and maintainability without changing behavior
  * **And:** It must ensure all tests continue to pass after refactoring
  * **And:** It must add appropriate documentation, error handling, and logging
  * **And:** Final code must meet production quality standards

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** TDD workflow implementation patterns, architectural compliance checking strategies, test framework integration patterns, and code quality standards for the project technology stack
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Security-conscious TDD practices, secure coding patterns for generated implementation code, input validation and sanitization in test scenarios, and secure refactoring techniques
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing TDD implementation examples, test framework usage patterns, architectural compliance validation examples, code generation algorithms and interfaces, and integration patterns for existing codebase interfaces

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the contract-to-test translation logic with various task blueprint formats, verify architectural compliance validation catches constraint violations, and validate the TDD workflow produces working, tested code
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete workflow from task bundle input through test generation, implementation, and refactoring to final code output, verify integration with project testing frameworks and architectural patterns, and test error handling for malformed inputs or architectural violations
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure the workflow follows SDD TDD methodology standards, verify compatibility with project coding standards and quality gates, and confirm that generated code integrates cleanly with existing project structure and dependencies

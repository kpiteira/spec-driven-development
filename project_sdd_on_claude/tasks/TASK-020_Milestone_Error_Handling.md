## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task enhances the milestone command with comprehensive error handling that provides clear failure reporting, preserves execution context for debugging, and guides Human Architects on appropriate next steps.

**Context:** This is the first task in Slice 2, building upon TASK-019's basic milestone execution to add robust error handling. This transforms the milestone command from a prototype that stops on errors to a production-ready system that provides actionable failure information and recovery guidance.

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive error handling for milestone execution that immediately stops on any task failure, provides detailed error information with specific guidance on next steps (retry, investigate, abort), and preserves all task bundle context for debugging and recovery.

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task enables reliable milestone execution by providing clear failure visibility and recovery guidance, ensuring Human Architects can make informed decisions when errors occur during autonomous execution.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: TASK-019 (Basic milestone command foundation)
- **Enables**: TASK-021 (Enhanced progress reporting), TASK-022 (State tracking)
- **Parallel OK**: None (error handling is foundational for other enhancements)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: TASK-019 milestone command foundation, existing task error handling from M2, Claude Code agent natural language understanding
- **Creates**: Comprehensive milestone error handling system, failure context preservation, recovery guidance generation
- **Modifies**: Milestone command execution flow, error reporting mechanisms

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Enhance existing milestone command with robust error capture and reporting, preserve debugging context through file-based state
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md` (enhance existing), error handling utilities, state preservation mechanisms
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (requires sophisticated error handling and context preservation)
- **Time Estimate**: 5 hours (error handling logic + context preservation + recovery guidance + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for comprehensive milestone error handling.

* **Behavior 1: Immediate Stop on Task Failure**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing and any task encounters a failure
  * **When:** The task failure is detected during execution
  * **Then:** Execution must stop immediately without attempting subsequent tasks
  * **And:** The failure must be clearly attributed to the specific task that failed
  * **And:** The system must preserve the exact point of failure for debugging
  * **And:** No cleanup or rollback should occur automatically (preserve state for investigation)

* **Behavior 2: Detailed Error Information and Context Preservation**
  * **Given:** A task failure has occurred during milestone execution
  * **When:** The error handling system processes the failure
  * **Then:** The system must provide detailed error information including task ID, failure reason, and execution context
  * **And:** All task bundle context must be preserved for the failed task (.task_bundles/TASK-XXX/)
  * **And:** The milestone execution state must be preserved to enable resume capability
  * **And:** Error messages must include specific details about what went wrong and where

* **Behavior 3: Recovery Guidance and Next Steps**
  * **Given:** A milestone execution has failed with preserved context
  * **When:** The error is reported to the Human Architect
  * **Then:** The system must provide specific guidance on next steps (retry, investigate, abort)
  * **And:** Guidance must be tailored to the type of failure encountered
  * **And:** Clear instructions must be provided for investigating the failure using preserved context
  * **And:** Recovery options must be clearly explained with their implications

* **Behavior 4: Execution State Visibility**
  * **Given:** A milestone execution has failed
  * **When:** The Human Architect needs to understand what was accomplished
  * **Then:** The system must clearly report which tasks completed successfully
  * **And:** The specific task that failed must be clearly identified
  * **And:** The tasks that were not attempted must be clearly indicated
  * **And:** The overall milestone progress must be summarized for recovery planning

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Error handling patterns for multi-task workflows, state preservation strategies for debugging, failure reporting best practices for Claude Code agents, integration with existing M2 error handling infrastructure
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure error information handling, protection against information leakage in error messages, safe preservation of execution context, validation of error handling flows
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing task error handling patterns from M2 task command, milestone execution state management interfaces, Claude Code error reporting conventions, debugging context preservation examples

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test error detection and immediate execution stop, verify detailed error information generation and context preservation, validate recovery guidance generation for different failure types, and confirm execution state reporting accuracy
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test error handling with various task failure scenarios, verify context preservation enables effective debugging, test the complete error handling workflow from failure detection to recovery guidance, and confirm integration with existing M2 error handling patterns
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure error handling follows SDD conventions for failure management, verify that preserved context maintains security and integrity requirements, confirm that error handling supports the resume capability requirements for future tasks, and validate that error reporting provides actionable information for Human Architects

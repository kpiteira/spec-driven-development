## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement basic task bundle directory creation and management for the `/task` command to support AI agent coordination in the SDD assembly line workflow.

**Context:** This task enables the `/task` command to create simple bundle directories where AI agents (Bundler, Coder, Validator) can read task blueprints and coordinate their work. Bundles provide context isolation and preserve failed tasks for debugging.

**Goal:** Enable the `/task` command to create `.task_bundles/TASK-ID/` directories, copy task blueprints, and handle basic cleanup after successful task completion or preserve bundles after failures.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for basic task bundle directory operations.

* **Behavior 1: Standard Bundle Structure Creation**
  * **Given:** A valid task blueprint and task ID (e.g., TASK-001)
  * **When:** The bundle creation process is initiated
  * **Then:** A `.task_bundles/TASK-001/` directory is created with proper permissions
  * **And:** The directory contains `task_blueprint.md` (copied from original)
  * **And:** No subdirectories are created within the bundle (context files are placed directly in bundle root)
  * **And:** A `bundle_status.yaml` file tracks the bundle lifecycle state

* **Behavior 2: Bundle Validation and Integrity**
  * **Given:** A task bundle directory
  * **When:** The `/task` command checks the bundle
  * **Then:** The directory exists and is accessible
  * **And:** The task blueprint file is present and readable
  * **And:** Bundle status can be tracked (created/completed/failed)
  * **And:** No corrupted bundle files exist

* **Behavior 3: Bundle Cleanup and Lifecycle Management**
  * **Given:** A completed or failed task bundle
  * **When:** The `/task` command finishes processing
  * **Then:** Successful bundles are removed to keep workspace clean
  * **And:** Failed bundles are preserved for manual inspection and debugging
  * **And:** Bundle lifecycle is tracked (created → processing → completed/failed)
  * **And:** No partial or corrupted bundle directories are left behind

* **Behavior 4: Conflict Detection and Resolution**
  * **Given:** An existing task bundle directory for the same task ID
  * **When:** The `/task` command attempts to create a new bundle
  * **Then:** The command detects the existing bundle and reports the conflict
  * **And:** Provides clear options (remove old bundle, preserve with timestamp)
  * **And:** Ensures no data loss during conflict resolution
  * **And:** Maintains clean filesystem state throughout the process

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support implementing basic bundle directory operations in the `/task` command.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Simple directory creation patterns, Claude Code file operations (Write, Read, LS tools), and bundle lifecycle management approach from SDD architecture specifications
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Safe file operations, input validation for task IDs, path validation to prevent directory traversal, and secure cleanup procedures  
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Claude Code command implementation patterns, file operation examples using Write/Read/LS tools, and error handling conventions for the `/task` command

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Manual Test Scope:** Test `/task` command creates bundle directories correctly, copies task blueprints, handles conflicts appropriately, and performs cleanup as expected
* **Integration Test Scope:** Verify `/task` command integrates with AI agents (Bundler, Coder, Validator) and supports the complete assembly line workflow from M2 milestone plan
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Verify bundle directory operations follow SDD architecture patterns and maintain clean workspace management without security vulnerabilities

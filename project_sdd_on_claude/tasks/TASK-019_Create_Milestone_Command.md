## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task creates the foundational `/milestone [name]` command that enables Claude Code agents to read and understand milestone plan documents, then execute their task sequences sequentially using existing infrastructure.

**Context:** This is the first task in the M4 milestone, establishing the core capability for autonomous milestone execution. It builds upon the proven `/task` command infrastructure from M2 to enable complete milestone automation. This represents the key transformation from individual task execution to full milestone orchestration.

**Goal:** Create a Claude Code slash command that can read any milestone plan document, comprehend its task sequences through natural language understanding, and execute each TASK-XXX identifier sequentially using the existing `/task` command infrastructure, providing the foundation for autonomous milestone execution.

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task enables the core REQ-004 capability for autonomous milestone execution, transforming the SDD system from individual task automation to complete milestone workflow automation.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: M2 `/task` command infrastructure, existing task bundle system
- **Enables**: TASK-020 (Error handling), TASK-021 (Progress reporting), all subsequent M4 tasks
- **Parallel OK**: None (foundational task that others depend on)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: Existing `/task` command infrastructure, task bundle system (.task_bundles/), Claude Code slash command patterns
- **Creates**: `/milestone` slash command, milestone plan document comprehension capability, sequential task execution orchestration
- **Modifies**: Command registry, adds new milestone execution workflow

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Create slash command using Claude Code's native command system, leverage natural language comprehension to understand milestone plan documents
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md`, integration with existing task workflow patterns
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (requires document comprehension and workflow orchestration)
- **Time Estimate**: 6 hours (command creation + document parsing + task sequencing + basic testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the basic milestone command functionality.

* **Behavior 1: Milestone Plan Document Comprehension**
  * **Given:** A milestone plan document exists (e.g., `4_M1_Milestone_Plan.md`, `5_M2_Milestone_Plan.md`)
  * **When:** `/milestone M1-Foundation` is executed
  * **Then:** The Claude Code agent must read and understand the milestone plan document to identify all TASK-XXX identifiers from Implementation Plan sections
  * **And:** The agent must extract task sequences in the order they appear in the milestone plan
  * **And:** The agent must understand task dependencies and vertical slice organization

* **Behavior 2: Sequential Task Execution Using Existing Infrastructure**
  * **Given:** A milestone plan with identified TASK-XXX sequences
  * **When:** The milestone command processes the task list
  * **Then:** Each task must be executed sequentially using the existing `/task TASK-ID` command from M2
  * **And:** Tasks must be executed in the order they appear in the milestone plan document
  * **And:** Each task execution must complete before starting the next task
  * **And:** The existing task bundle system (.task_bundles/) must be used for each task

* **Behavior 3: Basic Progress Reporting**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing with multiple tasks
  * **When:** Tasks are being processed sequentially
  * **Then:** The system must provide clear progress updates (e.g., "Starting TASK-001 [1/5]", "Completed TASK-001 [1/5]")
  * **And:** Progress updates must indicate current task and total task count
  * **And:** Task completion status must be clearly communicated

* **Behavior 4: Failure Handling with Immediate Stop**
  * **Given:** A task fails during milestone execution
  * **When:** Any individual task encounters an error
  * **Then:** Execution must stop immediately with clear error reporting
  * **And:** The failure message must identify which specific task failed
  * **And:** The system must preserve all context for debugging
  * **And:** No subsequent tasks should be attempted after a failure

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Claude Code slash command creation patterns, document comprehension strategies for milestone plans, task sequencing and orchestration patterns, integration with existing M2 task infrastructure
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure document reading practices, protection against malicious milestone plan content, safe task execution orchestration, validation of task identifiers and sequences
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing `/task` command implementation details, task bundle system interfaces, Claude Code command system patterns, milestone plan document structure examples, task execution workflow interfaces

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test milestone plan document reading and comprehension, verify task sequence extraction from milestone documents, validate sequential task execution using existing `/task` infrastructure, and confirm basic progress reporting functionality
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete workflow with actual milestone plan documents (M1, M2), verify integration with existing task bundle system, test failure scenarios where individual tasks fail, and confirm that the command works with different milestone plan formats
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure the milestone command follows Claude Code slash command conventions, verify compatibility with existing SDD workflow infrastructure, confirm that task execution maintains all existing validation and quality requirements from M2, and validate that the foundation supports the error handling and progress reporting requirements for subsequent tasks

## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements autonomous execution logic that enables Claude Code agents to execute milestones without unnecessary Human Architect prompts while maintaining appropriate interaction points for genuine guidance needs.

**Context:** This is the first task in Slice 4, building upon the complete state management foundation from Slice 3 to add intelligent autonomous operation. This transforms milestone execution from an interactive process to a truly autonomous workflow that respects Human Architect oversight.

**Goal:** Implement autonomous execution logic that enables Claude Code agents to operate independently during normal milestone execution while maintaining appropriate Human Architect interaction points for genuine guidance needs, creating the foundation for hands-off milestone automation.

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task enables the core value proposition of autonomous milestone execution by allowing Human Architects to initiate milestone execution and focus on other work while Claude Code agents handle routine execution autonomously.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: Complete Slice 3 foundation (TASK-022, TASK-023, TASK-024), existing M2 task automation
- **Enables**: TASK-026 (Hook integration), TASK-027 (Completion reporting)
- **Parallel OK**: None (autonomous logic is foundational for remaining Slice 4 tasks)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: Complete milestone execution infrastructure from Slices 1-3, existing autonomous patterns from M2 task execution, Claude Code agent decision-making capabilities
- **Creates**: Autonomous execution orchestration, Human Architect interaction points, intelligent guidance detection
- **Modifies**: Milestone execution workflow to operate autonomously with selective Human Architect engagement

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Implement intelligent decision-making logic that distinguishes between routine operations and genuine guidance needs, create clear interaction patterns
- **Key Files**: `.claude/commands/milestone.md` (enhance existing), autonomous execution logic, interaction point handling
- **Complexity**: Level 4 (requires sophisticated decision-making logic and Human Architect interaction design)
- **Time Estimate**: 8 hours (autonomous logic + interaction points + decision-making + edge cases + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for autonomous execution logic.

* **Behavior 1: Autonomous Operation During Normal Execution**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing with normal task progression
  * **When:** Tasks complete successfully and execution continues
  * **Then:** The system must continue execution autonomously without prompting the Human Architect
  * **And:** Autonomous operation must be the default behavior during normal milestone progression
  * **And:** Progress must continue seamlessly through all routine task execution scenarios
  * **And:** Autonomous execution must maintain all existing error handling and state management capabilities

* **Behavior 2: Intelligent Human Architect Interaction Point Detection**
  * **Given:** A milestone execution encounters scenarios requiring Human Architect guidance
  * **When:** The Claude Code agent evaluates whether Human Architect input is needed
  * **Then:** The system must distinguish between routine decisions (autonomous) and genuine guidance needs (require input)
  * **And:** Guidance needs must be limited to scenarios where Claude Code agent genuinely lacks sufficient information to proceed
  * **And:** Interaction points must not be triggered for routine failures (those should stop execution with clear error reporting)
  * **And:** The system must provide clear context about why Human Architect guidance is being requested

* **Behavior 3: Appropriate Guidance Request Handling**
  * **Given:** The Claude Code agent has determined that genuine Human Architect guidance is needed
  * **When:** An interaction point is triggered
  * **Then:** The system must provide clear context about the guidance need including current execution state, specific decision required, and available options
  * **And:** Guidance requests must preserve execution context and enable informed Human Architect decision-making
  * **And:** The system must accept Human Architect guidance and continue execution appropriately
  * **And:** Guidance handling must not disrupt the autonomous execution flow for subsequent operations

* **Behavior 4: Autonomous Execution State Management and Monitoring**
  * **Given:** A milestone is executing autonomously
  * **When:** The Human Architect wants to monitor progress or understand current state
  * **Then:** The system must provide clear visibility into autonomous execution status without disrupting the workflow
  * **And:** Execution state must be accessible for monitoring without requiring active Human Architect intervention
  * **And:** Autonomous execution must integrate seamlessly with existing progress reporting and error handling
  * **And:** The system must maintain clear logs of autonomous decisions and actions for transparency

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Autonomous execution patterns for multi-agent systems, Human Architect interaction point design, decision-making logic for Claude Code agents, integration with existing milestone execution infrastructure
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure autonomous execution practices, protection against unauthorized autonomous actions, validation of Human Architect interaction points, safe handling of guidance requests and decisions
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing autonomous execution patterns from M2 task system, milestone execution workflow interfaces, Human Architect interaction patterns, decision-making and guidance handling utilities

---

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test autonomous execution logic for correct decision-making about when to continue vs when to request guidance, verify Human Architect interaction point detection and handling, validate guidance request context and handling, and confirm autonomous execution state management and monitoring
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete autonomous milestone execution scenarios with minimal Human Architect intervention, verify autonomous execution integrates properly with all existing milestone infrastructure (error handling, progress reporting, state management), test Human Architect interaction points work correctly when guidance is genuinely needed, and confirm autonomous execution provides appropriate transparency and monitoring capabilities
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure autonomous execution logic follows SDD principles for Human Architect oversight and control, verify that autonomous operation maintains system integrity and doesn't introduce security or reliability risks, confirm that autonomous execution provides the intended value of hands-off milestone automation, and validate that Human Architect interaction points are genuinely needed and provide clear value

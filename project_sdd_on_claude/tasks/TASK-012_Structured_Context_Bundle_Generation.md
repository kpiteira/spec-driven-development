## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Implement comprehensive context bundle generation that combines semantic search, bash analysis, and architectural extraction into structured, high-quality context files optimized for Coder Agent consumption.

**Context:** This task completes Slice 2 by integrating all Bundler Agent capabilities into a cohesive context generation system. It creates the standardized context bundle format that prevents AI hallucination and enables consistent, accurate code generation.

**Goal:** Create a robust context bundle generation system that produces comprehensive, structured context files (bundle_architecture.md, bundle_code_context.md) that provide complete implementation guidance without requiring additional research or external dependencies.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for structured context bundle generation.

* **Behavior 1: Comprehensive Context Analysis Integration**
  * **Given:** Task blueprint requirements and completed analysis from semantic search and bash commands
  * **When:** Context bundle generation is performed
  * **Then:** All analysis sources are integrated into coherent, structured context
  * **And:** Context includes architectural rules, code patterns, interfaces, and implementation examples
  * **And:** Information is deduplicated and prioritized by relevance to task requirements
  * **And:** Generated context is sufficient for code generation without additional research

* **Behavior 2: Structured Architecture Context Generation**
  * **Given:** Project architectural specifications and task-specific requirements
  * **When:** `bundle_architecture.md` is generated
  * **Then:** File contains focused architectural rules and patterns relevant to the task
  * **And:** It includes technology choices, coding standards, and structural requirements
  * **And:** Architectural guidance is actionable and directly applicable to implementation
  * **And:** Content follows standardized format for optimal Coder Agent consumption

* **Behavior 3: Precise Code Context Generation**
  * **Given:** Discovered code patterns, interfaces, and implementation examples
  * **When:** `bundle_code_context.md` is generated
  * **Then:** File contains exact function signatures, class definitions, and API patterns
  * **And:** It includes relevant existing implementations as guidance and integration points
  * **And:** Code context prevents hallucination with precise, verified interface information
  * **And:** Examples and patterns are directly applicable to the task implementation

* **Behavior 4: Bundle Quality Validation and Optimization**
  * **Given:** Generated context bundle files
  * **When:** Bundle quality validation is performed
  * **Then:** Content completeness is verified against task requirements
  * **And:** Context bundle size is optimized for agent consumption without information loss
  * **And:** Generated files follow standardized format and structure
  * **And:** Bundle quality meets standards for enabling successful code generation

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support context bundle generation.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Context bundle format specifications, architectural extraction patterns, and content structuring guidelines. Include templates for bundle_architecture.md format and quality standards for architectural context
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure context generation practices, content validation methods, and protection against malicious content in analysis results. Include guidance on sanitizing extracted content and validating context quality
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Context bundle file formats, content structuring patterns, and generation algorithms. Include examples of high-quality bundle_code_context.md files and optimization techniques for agent consumption

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate context integration accuracy, bundle file generation quality, content structure compliance, and optimization effectiveness
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify generated context bundles enable successful code generation, integrate properly with the assembly line workflow, and meet quality standards consistently across different task types
* **Project-Wide Checks:** Context bundle quality assessment, format compliance validation, and verification that generated bundles provide sufficient context for accurate code generation without external dependencies

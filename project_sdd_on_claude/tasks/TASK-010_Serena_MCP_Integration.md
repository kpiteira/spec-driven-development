## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Integrate Serena MCP server into the Bundler Agent to provide semantic code search capabilities that discover relevant implementations, patterns, and interfaces within the local codebase.

**Context:** This task enhances the Bundler Agent with advanced code discovery capabilities using Serena's semantic search. This enables the agent to find similar implementations, related patterns, and relevant code examples that inform better context bundle creation.

**Goal:** Implement robust Serena MCP integration that enables semantic code search, pattern discovery, and intelligent code analysis to create more comprehensive and accurate context bundles for code generation.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for Serena MCP integration.

* **Behavior 1: Serena MCP Connection and Configuration**
  * **Given:** A Bundler Agent task requiring semantic code search
  * **When:** Serena MCP integration is initialized
  * **Then:** The agent successfully connects to the Serena MCP server
  * **And:** MCP connection is configured with appropriate scope for the local codebase
  * **And:** Connection failures are handled gracefully with fallback to basic analysis
  * **And:** MCP usage follows security best practices for local codebase access

* **Behavior 2: Semantic Code Pattern Discovery**
  * **Given:** A task blueprint describing functionality to implement
  * **When:** Serena semantic search is performed
  * **Then:** The system discovers similar existing implementations in the codebase
  * **And:** It identifies related patterns, helper functions, and integration points
  * **And:** Search results are ranked by relevance to the specific task requirements
  * **And:** Pattern discovery includes both exact matches and conceptually similar code

* **Behavior 3: Interface and Dependency Analysis**
  * **Given:** Task requirements and semantic search results
  * **When:** Interface analysis is performed using Serena
  * **Then:** The system identifies exact function signatures and class interfaces to use
  * **And:** It discovers dependencies, imports, and required libraries
  * **And:** It maps relationships between different code components
  * **And:** Interface information is precise enough to prevent API hallucination

* **Behavior 4: Context Bundle Enhancement with Semantic Results**
  * **Given:** Semantic search results and existing context analysis
  * **When:** Context bundle generation integrates Serena findings
  * **Then:** Bundle content includes discovered patterns and implementations
  * **And:** Semantic results enhance architectural understanding with concrete examples
  * **And:** Code context includes relevant existing implementations as guidance
  * **And:** Enhanced context bundles enable more accurate and consistent code generation

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents to support Serena MCP integration.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** MCP server integration patterns, semantic search strategies, and local codebase analysis architectures. Include guidance on MCP connection management, search optimization, and result processing patterns
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure MCP server connections, safe semantic search practices, and protection against information leakage during code analysis. Include guidance on scoping searches appropriately and sanitizing results
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Serena MCP server interfaces, semantic search APIs, connection handling patterns, and result processing mechanisms. Include examples of search queries, result parsing, and integration with bundle generation

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** Tests must validate MCP connection handling, semantic search functionality, result processing accuracy, and integration with existing Bundler Agent capabilities
* **Integration Test Scope:** Integration tests must verify Serena MCP enhances context bundle quality, integrates seamlessly with the assembly line workflow, and provides reliable semantic search results for various task types
* **Project-Wide Checks:** MCP security validation, semantic search result quality assessment, and verification that enhanced context bundles improve code generation accuracy and reduce hallucination

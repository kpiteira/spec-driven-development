## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Create an installation script that sets up the SDD system by copying specification templates to a global location (`~/.sdd/templates/`) and SDD commands to the user's Claude Code commands directory (`.claude/commands/`).

**Goal:** Enable easy SDD system installation through a git clone workflow that properly configures both global templates and Claude Code commands, making the system immediately usable after installation.

**Context:** This script is the foundation for SDD system distribution and ensures users can quickly adopt the SDD methodology without manual file management. It implements the global template strategy that avoids polluting individual project repositories.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for the installation script functionality and behavior.

* **Behavior 1: Global Template Installation**
  * **Given:** The SDD repository contains specification templates
  * **When:** The installation script executes
  * **Then:** All specification templates must be copied to `~/.sdd/templates/` directory
  * **And:** Directory structure must be created if it doesn't exist
  * **And:** Existing templates must be backed up or updated appropriately
  * **And:** Templates must be accessible for command execution

* **Behavior 2: Claude Code Commands Installation**
  * **Given:** The SDD repository contains command definitions
  * **When:** The installation script executes
  * **Then:** All SDD command files must be copied to `.claude/commands/` directory
  * **And:** The `.claude/commands/` directory must be created if it doesn't exist
  * **And:** Commands must be immediately discoverable by Claude Code
  * **And:** Existing SDD commands must be updated without breaking other commands

* **Behavior 3: Installation Validation**
  * **Given:** The installation script completes
  * **When:** Validation checks run
  * **Then:** All template files must be verified as present and readable
  * **And:** All command files must be verified as present and properly formatted
  * **And:** Claude Code must recognize the installed commands
  * **And:** Installation success must be clearly reported to the user

* **Behavior 4: Error Handling and Recovery**
  * **Given:** Various error conditions during installation
  * **When:** Errors occur (permission issues, missing directories, etc.)
  * **Then:** Clear error messages must guide user remediation
  * **And:** Partial installations must be safely recoverable
  * **And:** The script must fail safely without corrupting existing configurations
  * **And:** Installation logs must be available for troubleshooting

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** This section serves as a manifest for the context files that will be provided by the Bundler and Security Consultant agents.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Contains file system organization principles, installation patterns, and directory structure requirements from the SDD system architecture.
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Contains security guidance for installation scripts, file permission handling, backup strategies, and safe installation practices.
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Contains implementation details for:
  * **File System Operations:** Safe file copying, directory creation, and permission handling patterns
  * **Claude Code Integration:** Understanding of `.claude/commands/` directory structure and command discovery mechanisms
  * **Installation Best Practices:** Error handling, validation, logging, and user feedback patterns for installation scripts

---

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for the Validator Agent on how to verify this task's completion.

* **Installation Test Suite:** Tests must verify successful installation across different operating systems and environments with various permission scenarios.
* **Command Discovery Verification:** Tests must confirm that installed commands appear in Claude Code's `/help` output and are executable.
* **Template Access Verification:** Tests must confirm that installed templates are accessible and properly formatted for command usage.
* **Error Scenario Testing:** Tests must validate proper error handling for permission issues, missing directories, and partial installation failures.

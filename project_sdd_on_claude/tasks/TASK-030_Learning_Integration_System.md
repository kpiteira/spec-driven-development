## Implementation Context for Claude Code Agents

**Agent Guidance:** This task will be implemented by Claude Code agents using natural language understanding capabilities. When you read instructions to "parse files" or "extract information," interpret this as reading and understanding documents using your natural language comprehension, not building programmatic parsers or extraction systems.

**Process Flow:** This task will be executed through the SDD assembly line: Bundler Specialist (context research) → Coder Specialist (TDD implementation) → Validator Specialist (comprehensive testing). Each specialist uses document comprehension to understand requirements and context.

**Architecture Compliance:** All implementation must follow the project's architecture specifications as understood through document analysis, not through algorithmic rule enforcement.

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task implements the learning integration system that combines agent self-analysis with Human Architect feedback to create comprehensive retrospective documents for future process improvement and integration into milestone planning workflows.

**Context:** This is the final task in Slice 5 and the M4 milestone, completing the comprehensive retrospective system by integrating agent insights with human feedback to create actionable learning documents that feed back into the SDD process improvement cycle.

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive learning integration that combines agent self-analysis from TASK-029 with Human Architect feedback to create structured retrospective documents, stores learning outcomes for future reference, and integrates retrospective insights into the `/plan_milestone` process as specified in Phase 2.6.

## 2. Integration Context

### Why This Task Exists
This task completes the learning cycle by ensuring that retrospective insights from both agents and humans are captured in actionable form and integrated back into the milestone planning process for continuous improvement.

### Dependencies & Flow
- **Requires**: TASK-029 (Retrospective analysis), agent self-analysis capabilities, complete milestone execution experience
- **Enables**: Complete retrospective workflow, integration with `/plan_milestone` Phase 2.6, continuous process improvement
- **Parallel OK**: None (learning integration is the final step in the retrospective workflow)

### Architectural Integration
- **Leverages**: TASK-029 retrospective analysis results, Human Architect feedback collection, existing milestone planning infrastructure
- **Creates**: Learning integration system, comprehensive retrospective document generation, learning storage and retrieval for future planning
- **Modifies**: Overall SDD workflow to include learning integration, enhances `/plan_milestone` with retrospective insights

### Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Implement system that combines structured agent analysis with human feedback to create comprehensive learning documents and integration points
- **Key Files**: Learning integration utilities, retrospective document generation, learning storage and retrieval systems, integration with milestone planning
- **Complexity**: Level 4 (requires sophisticated integration of agent and human insights with planning process integration)
- **Time Estimate**: 8 hours (learning integration + document generation + storage system + planning integration + testing)

## 3. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for learning integration system.

* **Behavior 1: Agent Analysis and Human Feedback Integration**
  * **Given:** Agent self-analysis from TASK-029 is available and Human Architect feedback has been collected
  * **When:** Learning integration processes both agent and human insights
  * **Then:** The system must combine agent retrospective analysis with Human Architect feedback to create comprehensive learning insights
  * **And:** Integration must preserve both agent-identified patterns and human strategic insights while resolving any conflicts or disagreements
  * **And:** Combined insights must be more valuable than either agent analysis or human feedback alone
  * **And:** Integration must maintain traceability to both agent analysis and human feedback sources

* **Behavior 2: Comprehensive Retrospective Document Generation**
  * **Given:** Integrated agent and human insights are available
  * **When:** Retrospective document generation is triggered
  * **Then:** The system must create comprehensive retrospective documents that capture both agent performance insights and human strategic feedback
  * **And:** Retrospective documents must be structured for future reference during milestone planning (supporting `/plan_milestone` Phase 2.6)
  * **And:** Documents must include specific process improvements, lesson learned, and recommendations for future planning and execution
  * **And:** Document generation must produce actionable insights that can be practically applied to improve future milestone execution

* **Behavior 3: Learning Storage and Retrieval for Future Planning**
  * **Given:** Comprehensive retrospective documents have been generated
  * **When:** Learning storage processes the retrospective insights
  * **Then:** The system must store learning outcomes in a format accessible for future milestone planning processes
  * **And:** Learning storage must enable retrieval of relevant retrospective insights during `/plan_milestone` execution (Phase 2.6 integration)
  * **And:** Storage system must organize learning insights by categories relevant to milestone planning (process improvements, common issues, best practices)
  * **And:** Learning retrieval must provide contextually relevant insights based on current milestone planning context

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Milestone Planning Process**
  * **Given:** Learning insights are stored and available for future planning
  * **When:** `/plan_milestone` Phase 2.6 retrospective integration is executed
  * **Then:** The system must provide relevant retrospective insights to inform current milestone planning decisions
  * **And:** Planning integration must present learning insights in a format that enhances milestone planning effectiveness
  * **And:** Integration must enable Human Architects to apply retrospective lessons to current planning without overwhelming the planning process
  * **And:** Planning integration must demonstrate measurable improvement in milestone planning quality through retrospective learning application

## 4. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Learning integration patterns for continuous improvement systems, retrospective document generation strategies, learning storage and retrieval architectures, integration with milestone planning processes
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure learning data handling, protection against learning manipulation or corruption, validation of retrospective document integrity, safe integration with milestone planning workflows
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** TASK-029 retrospective analysis interfaces, Human Architect feedback collection patterns, document generation utilities, learning storage systems, `/plan_milestone` integration points

## 5. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test agent analysis and human feedback integration accuracy and completeness, verify comprehensive retrospective document generation produces actionable and well-structured learning insights, validate learning storage and retrieval systems support effective future planning integration, and confirm integration with milestone planning process enhances planning effectiveness
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete learning integration workflow from retrospective analysis through milestone planning integration, verify learning integration creates genuine value for continuous process improvement, test learning integration with real retrospective data and human feedback across multiple milestone scenarios, and confirm learning integration supports the `/plan_milestone` Phase 2.6 requirements effectively
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure learning integration completes the comprehensive retrospective system as specified in M4 milestone goals, verify that learning integration provides measurable improvement in milestone planning and execution effectiveness, confirm that retrospective learning system creates sustainable continuous improvement for the SDD methodology, and validate that learning integration fulfills the M4 milestone's complete autonomous execution and learning objectives

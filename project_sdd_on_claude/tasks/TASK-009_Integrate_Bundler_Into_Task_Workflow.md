## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** This task integrates the Bundler Agent (created in TASK-007 and enhanced in TASK-008) into the `/task` command workflow, establishing the first stage of the SDD assembly line pattern. It creates the orchestration logic that invokes the Bundler Agent and handles the results.

**Context:** This is the final task in Slice 2, completing the MVP Bundler Agent implementation by connecting it to the main task execution workflow. This integration establishes the foundation for the assembly line pattern that will be extended with additional agents in subsequent slices.

**Goal:** Modify the existing `/task` command (from TASK-005) to invoke the Bundler Agent as the first step in task processing, handle bundler execution results, implement proper error handling and recovery, and prepare the task bundle for downstream processing by other agents.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for integrating the Bundler Agent into the task workflow.

* **Behavior 1: Bundler Agent Invocation**
  * **Given:** A valid task blueprint exists and `/task TASK-ID` is executed
  * **When:** The task command processes the blueprint
  * **Then:** It must invoke the Bundler Agent using Claude Code's Task tool with clean context isolation
  * **And:** It must pass the task blueprint and task bundle directory path to the Bundler Agent
  * **And:** The Bundler Agent must be invoked with the correct model (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
  * **And:** Bundler execution must be logged and traceable for debugging

* **Behavior 2: Context Bundle Validation**
  * **Given:** The Bundler Agent has completed execution
  * **When:** The task command receives the bundler results
  * **Then:** It must validate that required context files (`bundle_architecture.md`, `bundle_code_context.md`) exist
  * **And:** It must verify that context files are non-empty and contain valid content
  * **And:** It must check that the task bundle directory structure is complete and consistent
  * **And:** Successful validation must prepare the bundle for the next stage in the assembly line

* **Behavior 3: Error Handling and Recovery**
  * **Given:** The Bundler Agent encounters failures during execution
  * **When:** Bundler errors are reported back to the task command
  * **Then:** The task command must capture and log specific error details for debugging
  * **And:** It must preserve the partial task bundle for troubleshooting and recovery
  * **And:** It must provide clear, actionable error messages to the Human Architect
  * **And:** Failed bundler operations must not corrupt the workspace or leave inconsistent state

* **Behavior 4: Assembly Line Preparation**
  * **Given:** The Bundler Agent has successfully created a complete context bundle
  * **When:** The bundling stage is complete
  * **Then:** The task command must prepare the bundle for the next agent in the assembly line
  * **And:** It must validate that all required context is available for downstream processing
  * **And:** It must update task execution state to track progress through the workflow
  * **And:** The bundle must be ready for handoff to the Coder Agent (to be implemented in Slice 3)

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Assembly line orchestration patterns, Claude Code Task tool integration patterns, sub-agent invocation and error handling strategies, and workflow state management approaches for multi-agent coordination
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure sub-agent invocation practices, input validation for task bundle processing, error handling security considerations, and safe handling of dynamic agent execution results
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing `/task` command implementation from TASK-005, Claude Code Task tool usage patterns, sub-agent integration examples, error handling and logging patterns, and task bundle management interfaces

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test Bundler Agent invocation with various task blueprint scenarios, verify error handling for bundler failures and invalid inputs, and validate context bundle validation logic for completeness and correctness
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test the complete workflow from `/task` command execution through Bundler Agent processing to context bundle creation, verify clean context isolation and proper model selection for sub-agent execution, and test error recovery scenarios with partial bundle creation
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure integration follows SDD assembly line pattern specifications, verify adherence to Claude Code sub-agent invocation standards, and confirm that workflow state management maintains system integrity and debugging capabilities

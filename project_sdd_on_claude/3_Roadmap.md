# Project Roadmap: SDD System for Claude Code

This document outlines the strategic, milestone-based plan for developing the SDD System on the Claude Code platform. The roadmap is designed to deliver value incrementally, respecting the logical dependencies of the system's architecture.

## Milestone 1: Project Initialization & Planning

**Goal:** To empower the Human Architect to set up a new project and create a complete, actionable plan for the first milestone. This establishes the foundational workflow.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Commands:**
  - `/init_greenfield`: The starting point. Implements the creation of the `specs/` directory and all its templates.
  - `/plan_milestone`: The core planning tool. Implements the guided process for creating a `Milestone_Plan.md` from the roadmap, including defining vertical slices and task blueprints.
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to initialize a new project..."
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to plan a new milestone..."

## Milestone 2: Core Task Execution

**Goal:** To build the "inner loop" of the assembly line. This milestone makes the plans created in Milestone 1 executable.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Commands:**
  - `/task [task_id]`: Implements the core task execution workflow.
- **Sub-Agents:**
  - `Bundler` (MVP version): Implements the critical logic for analyzing the **local codebase** and creating the context bundle.
- **Hooks & Notifications:**
  - Implement a basic notification for when a `/task` command is complete.
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to initiate a single development task..."

## Milestone 3: Full Validation & Security

**Goal:** To complete the core assembly line by adding the critical quality and security gates, ensuring each individual task is robust and reliable.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Sub-Agents:**
  - `Validator`: Implements the agent that runs tests and performs static analysis.
  - `SecurityConsultant`: Implements the agent that provides proactive security advice.
- **Hooks & Notifications:**
  - Integrate validation results into notifications (pass/fail).

## Milestone 4: Basic Milestone Execution

**Goal:** To scale the perfected assembly line by enabling the basic autonomous execution of an entire milestone.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Commands:**
  - `/milestone [name]`: Implements the orchestrator logic that reads a `Milestone_Plan.md` and executes the `/task` command for each task in sequence.
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to launch the execution of an entire milestone..."

## Milestone 5: Enhanced Milestone Features

**Goal:** To improve the milestone execution experience with resume capability and status reporting.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Enhanced `/milestone` Command:**
  - Resume capability: Skip tasks that are already completed
  - Status reporting: Integration with hook system for milestone progress notifications
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to resume milestone execution after interruptions..."
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to receive notifications about milestone progress..."

## Milestone 6: Brownfield Project Support

**Goal:** To enable the SDD system to work with existing codebases and projects.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Commands:**
  - `/init_brownfield`: Implements the discovery workflow for existing codebases.
- **Enhanced Bundler:**
  - Analyze existing project structure and conventions
  - Discover existing patterns and architectural decisions
  - Understand existing testing and build processes
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to onboard an existing project..."
  - "As a Human Architect, I want to understand existing codebase patterns..."

## Milestone 7: Advanced Bundler Capabilities

**Goal:** To extend the Bundler to analyze third-party libraries and external documentation for comprehensive context.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Enhanced Bundler Features:**
  - Third-party library analysis and documentation parsing
  - External API documentation integration
  - Complex dependency analysis and compatibility checking
  - Framework-specific pattern recognition
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want comprehensive analysis of external dependencies..."
  - "As a Human Architect, I want framework-specific guidance and patterns..."

## Milestone 8: Advanced Features

**Goal:** To add sophisticated capabilities that enhance the development workflow.

### Requirements Addressed in this Milestone

- **Advanced Validation:**
  - Cross-project pattern recognition
  - Advanced quality gates and metrics
  - Performance analysis and optimization suggestions
- **User Stories Fulfilled:**
  - "As a Human Architect, I want advanced code analysis capabilities..."

## Milestone 9: Future & Experimental Features

**Goal:** To explore experimental features and advanced AI capabilities that could evolve the SDD system.

### Experimental Features for Research

- **Agent Self-Introspection & Learning:**
  - Agents analyze their own performance and decision-making
  - Generate retrospective documents identifying process improvements
  - Learn from failures and successes across projects

- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition:**
  - Store cross-project patterns in `~/.sdd/preferences/` (user-level patterns)  
  - Analyze past project choices to suggest intelligent defaults
  - Transform "What do you want?" into "Continue using X like last time?"

- **Advanced Notifications & Analytics:**
  - Sophisticated hook system with rich event data
  - Performance analytics and bottleneck identification
  - Predictive failure detection and prevention

- **Cross-Project Intelligence:**
  - Learn technology stack patterns, quality approaches, UX patterns
  - Team-level pattern sharing and collaboration
  - Community pattern libraries and best practice propagation

### Example Vision: Pattern Learning Evolution

**Current State:**
```
SDD: "What package manager do you want for Python?"
SDD: "What testing framework should we use?"
```

**Future State:**
```
SDD: "I see you've used UV in 3 recent Python projects. Continue with UV? [Y/n]"
SDD: "Use pytest + coverage like your last 2 projects? [Y/n]"
```

### Research Areas

- **Team vs Individual Patterns:** Balancing personal preferences with team standards
- **Pattern Evolution:** How preferences change over time and technology trends
- **Agent Coordination:** Advanced multi-agent collaboration and learning
- **Quality Prediction:** Using historical data to predict task success/failure

*Note: This milestone contains experimental features that may or may not be implemented based on research findings and user feedback.*

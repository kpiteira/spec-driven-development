# Milestone Plan: M5 - Enhanced Milestone Features

**Purpose of this document:** This document provides a detailed tactical plan for enhancing the existing `/milestone [name]` command with resume capability and basic milestone notifications. It enables Claude Code agents to skip completed tasks when resuming milestone execution and provides progress notifications through the hook system.

## 1. Milestone Goals & Success Criteria

**Goal:** Enhance the existing `/milestone [name]` command with resume capability and basic milestone progress notifications, making milestone execution more robust and user-friendly when interruptions occur.

**Success Criteria:**
* **Given** a milestone execution was interrupted after completing some tasks
* **When** I re-execute `/milestone [milestone-name]` 
* **Then** the Claude Code agent detects which tasks are already completed and resumes from the first uncompleted task
* **And** provides clear status about which tasks are being skipped
* **And** sends basic milestone progress notifications through the existing hook system
* **And** notifies when milestone starts, each task completes, and milestone finishes
* **And** maintains all existing functionality from M4 (sequential execution, error handling, autonomous operation)

**User Value Delivered:**
* Milestone execution can be safely interrupted and resumed without losing progress
* Human Architects receive automated notifications about milestone progress
* No need to manually track which tasks were completed in interrupted executions

## 2. Scope: Features & Requirements

**Functional Requirements In Scope:**
* **REQ-004**: Enhanced `/milestone [name]` command with resume capability and status reporting
* Resume capability: Skip tasks that are already completed
* Basic milestone notifications: Integration with hook system for milestone progress notifications

**Non-Functional Requirements In Scope:**
* **NFR-REL-002**: Failure isolation - failed operations leave system in recoverable state
* **NFR-UX-001**: Command clarity with comprehensive progress feedback
* **NFR-PERF-005**: Implementation efficiency using `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for orchestration

**Integration Points:**
* **Existing M4 Infrastructure**: Build upon current `/milestone` command functionality
* **Task Bundle System**: Use existing `.task_bundles/TASK-ID/` structure for completion detection
* **Hook System**: Leverage existing notification infrastructure for milestone events

**Explicitly Out of Scope:**
* Complex dependency management (maintain simple sequential execution)
* Advanced notification features (keep basic milestone progress only)
* Parallel task execution (sequential execution remains the pattern)
* Custom notification configuration (use existing hook infrastructure)

## 3. Implementation Plan: Vertical Slices

### **Slice 1: Resume Capability Implementation**

**Goal:** Add task completion detection and resume logic to the existing `/milestone` command so interrupted executions can continue from where they left off.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** a milestone execution was interrupted after completing some tasks
* **When** I execute `/milestone [milestone-name]` again
* **Then** the Claude Code agent analyzes existing `.task_bundles/` directories to identify completed tasks
* **And** skips completed tasks with clear status messages (e.g., "TASK-001 already completed, skipping...")
* **And** resumes execution from the first uncompleted task
* **And** handles partially failed tasks by treating them as uncompleted and restarting from the beginning

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-031:** Enhance `/milestone` command to detect completed tasks by analyzing `.task_bundles/TASK-XXX/` directories for success indicators
2. **TASK-032:** Implement resume logic that skips completed tasks and continues from first uncompleted task with clear progress reporting

---

### **Slice 2: Basic Milestone Notifications**

**Goal:** Add basic milestone progress notifications through the existing hook system to keep Human Architects informed of milestone execution status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** a milestone execution is running
* **When** key milestone events occur (start, task completion, milestone completion)
* **Then** the system sends notifications through the existing hook system
* **And** notifications include milestone started, each individual task completed, and milestone finished
* **And** notification content includes milestone name, task ID, and basic status information
* **And** notifications integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure without disrupting execution

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-033:** Add milestone start and completion notifications to `/milestone` command using existing hook infrastructure
2. **TASK-034:** Add individual task completion notifications during milestone execution for progress tracking

---

## 4. Testing & Verification Plan

**Project-Level Checks (Always On):**

* All existing M4 `/milestone` command functionality remains intact
* Resume capability correctly identifies completed vs incomplete tasks
* Milestone notifications integrate properly with existing hook system
* Sequential task execution maintains proper ordering
* Error handling preserves existing stop-on-failure behavior

**Per-Slice Validation:**
* **Slice 1:** Verify resume capability detects completed tasks and restarts from correct checkpoint across various interruption scenarios
* **Slice 2:** Verify milestone notifications are sent for key events without disrupting autonomous execution

**Final Milestone Acceptance Tests:**
* **Complete Resume Functionality:** Interrupt milestone execution at different points and verify resume works correctly
* **Notification Integration:** Execute complete milestone and verify all expected notifications are sent through hook system
* **Backward Compatibility:** Test with existing milestone plans to ensure no regression in functionality
* **Error Scenarios:** Verify resume handles edge cases (partially failed tasks, corrupted bundles) gracefully

## 5. Definition of Done

**Milestone 5 is complete when:**
* `/milestone [name]` command includes working resume capability that detects completed tasks and continues from correct checkpoint
* Resume functionality skips completed tasks with clear status reporting
* Basic milestone notifications are integrated with existing hook system
* Notifications are sent for milestone start, individual task completion, and milestone completion events
* All existing M4 functionality (sequential execution, error handling, autonomous operation) is preserved
* Resume capability works reliably across various interruption and restart scenarios
* Notification system operates without disrupting autonomous milestone execution

**Success Validation:**
* Manual testing demonstrates successful resume after interrupting milestone execution at various points
* Milestone notifications are received through hook system for all key events
* Existing milestone plans continue to work without modification
* Resume capability handles edge cases (failed tasks, missing bundles) appropriately
* Integration testing confirms compatibility with existing SDD workflow infrastructure

## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Integrate a comprehensive logging system into the SDD workflow that captures key events, performance metrics, and error conditions across all agents in the assembly line. This sample demonstrates integration and workflow enhancement patterns that span multiple system components.

**Context:** This sample blueprint illustrates how to implement cross-cutting concerns that enhance the entire SDD system. It represents a realistic development scenario and example where you need to add observability and monitoring capabilities that integrate with existing workflows without disrupting core functionality.

**Goal:** Build a logging integration that captures workflow execution details, agent performance data, and error conditions while maintaining clean separation of concerns and ensuring the logging system doesn't impact the core development workflow performance or reliability.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for creating a comprehensive logging integration that demonstrates workflow enhancement patterns.

* **Behavior 1: Workflow Event Logging**
  * **Given:** The SDD workflow executes through various phases (bundling, security analysis, coding, validation)
  * **When:** Key workflow events occur (phase starts, completions, transitions, errors)
  * **Then:** All events must be logged with appropriate detail levels and structured formatting
  * **And:** Log entries must include timestamps, phase identifiers, task IDs, and execution context
  * **And:** Logging must capture both successful operations and error conditions with full stack traces
  * **And:** Log data must be stored in easily searchable and analyzable formats

* **Behavior 2: Agent Performance Monitoring**
  * **Given:** Multiple agents operate within the SDD assembly line
  * **When:** Each agent processes tasks and generates outputs
  * **Then:** Agent execution times, resource usage, and output quality metrics must be logged
  * **And:** Performance data must include agent invocation details, processing duration, and result validation
  * **And:** Memory usage, file operations, and external tool invocations must be tracked
  * **And:** Performance trends must be captured to identify optimization opportunities

* **Behavior 3: Error Tracking and Recovery Logging**
  * **Given:** Errors and exceptions can occur at any point in the workflow
  * **When:** Error conditions are encountered during execution
  * **Then:** Complete error context must be logged including cause, affected components, and recovery actions
  * **And:** Error logs must include sufficient detail for debugging without exposing sensitive information
  * **And:** Recovery attempt outcomes must be logged to track system resilience
  * **And:** Error patterns must be identifiable through log analysis for proactive improvements

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Existing Systems**
  * **Given:** The SDD system uses file-based state and Claude Code platform features
  * **When:** Logging integration is implemented
  * **Then:** Logging must integrate seamlessly with existing hook system and agent workflows
  * **And:** Log storage must use file-based approaches consistent with SDD architecture
  * **And:** Logging configuration must be manageable through existing project configuration patterns
  * **And:** The integration must not introduce external dependencies or compromise system portability

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** SDD assembly line integration patterns and hook system architecture, cross-cutting concern implementation strategies, file-based logging and state management patterns, and workflow enhancement approaches that maintain system integrity
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure logging practices that protect sensitive information, log data sanitization and filtering techniques, secure file operations for log storage and rotation, and protection against log injection attacks and information disclosure
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing SDD hook system implementation details, workflow execution patterns and integration points, logging framework options compatible with Claude Code environment, and configuration management approaches for logging settings

---

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that logging components integrate properly with existing SDD infrastructure, test log entry formatting and data completeness, and validate configuration management functionality works correctly across different environments
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete workflow execution with logging enabled, verify performance impact remains within acceptable bounds, and validate that logged data provides sufficient detail for operational monitoring and debugging
* **Workflow Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test logging behavior during error conditions and recovery scenarios, verify log data integrity during concurrent operations, and confirm that logging doesn't interfere with normal workflow execution
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure logging integration follows SDD architectural principles, maintains file-based state management consistency, and enhances system observability without compromising security or performance

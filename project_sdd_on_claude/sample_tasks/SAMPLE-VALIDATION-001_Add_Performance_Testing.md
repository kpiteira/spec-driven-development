## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Enhance the SDD validation pipeline with comprehensive performance testing capabilities that measure execution times, resource usage, and scalability characteristics of the complete workflow. This sample demonstrates validation enhancement patterns that improve system quality assurance.

**Context:** This sample blueprint illustrates how to enhance existing validation systems with additional quality gates and monitoring capabilities. It represents a realistic development scenario example where performance requirements need to be validated systematically and continuously to ensure system reliability at scale.

**Goal:** Build performance testing infrastructure that integrates with the existing SDD validation workflow, measures key performance indicators across all system components, and provides actionable insights for optimization while maintaining compatibility with the file-based architecture.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for adding comprehensive performance testing to the SDD validation pipeline.

* **Behavior 1: Workflow Performance Measurement**
  * **Given:** The SDD workflow executes complete task processing cycles
  * **When:** Performance testing is enabled during validation
  * **Then:** Execution times must be measured for each workflow phase (bundling, coding, validation)
  * **And:** Memory usage, file I/O operations, and CPU utilization must be tracked throughout execution
  * **And:** Performance metrics must be compared against established baseline thresholds
  * **And:** Performance data must be stored in structured format for trend analysis

* **Behavior 2: Agent Performance Benchmarking**
  * **Given:** Individual agents (Bundler, Coder, Validator) process tasks of varying complexity
  * **When:** Performance benchmarks are executed
  * **Then:** Each agent's processing time must be measured across different task types and sizes
  * **And:** Resource consumption patterns must be analyzed for memory leaks and inefficient operations
  * **And:** Agent scalability must be tested with increasing task complexity and context size
  * **And:** Performance comparisons must identify optimization opportunities

* **Behavior 3: System Scalability Validation**
  * **Given:** The SDD system processes multiple concurrent tasks and large context bundles
  * **When:** Scalability testing is performed
  * **Then:** System behavior under load must be measured and validated against performance requirements
  * **And:** File system operations must remain efficient as project size and complexity increase
  * **And:** Context bundle generation time must scale reasonably with codebase size
  * **And:** Validation pipeline must maintain acceptable performance as test suite size grows

* **Behavior 4: Performance Regression Detection**
  * **Given:** Performance baselines are established for system components
  * **When:** New code changes are validated
  * **Then:** Performance tests must detect regressions that exceed acceptable threshold variations
  * **And:** Performance reports must clearly identify components with degraded performance
  * **And:** Automated alerts must be generated for significant performance regressions
  * **And:** Performance test results must be integrated with existing validation reporting

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** SDD validation pipeline architecture and integration patterns, performance measurement strategies compatible with file-based systems, benchmarking frameworks suitable for Claude Code environment, and testing infrastructure enhancement approaches
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure performance data collection and storage practices, protection against performance testing attacks and resource exhaustion, secure handling of system metrics and resource utilization data, and validation of performance test integrity
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing SDD validation system implementation details, performance measurement tool integrations available in Claude Code environment, testing framework patterns and reporting mechanisms, and system monitoring approaches for file-based workflows

---

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that performance testing components integrate correctly with existing validation pipeline, test measurement accuracy and reliability across different execution scenarios, and validate that performance thresholds and alerting mechanisms function properly
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test complete performance validation workflow from measurement through reporting, verify that performance testing doesn't significantly impact normal workflow execution, and validate performance data collection and analysis accuracy
* **Performance Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that performance tests themselves execute efficiently and don't create performance bottlenecks, test scalability of performance measurement infrastructure, and validate that performance regression detection works correctly across different change types
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure performance testing integration maintains SDD architectural principles, verify compatibility with existing quality gates and validation processes, and confirm that performance insights lead to actionable optimization recommendations

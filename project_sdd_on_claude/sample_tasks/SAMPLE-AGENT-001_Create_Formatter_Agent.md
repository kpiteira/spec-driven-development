## 1. Task Overview & Goal

**What it is:** Create the Formatter Agent as a Claude Code sub-agent responsible for applying consistent code formatting, style guidelines, and best practices across generated code. This sample demonstrates the pattern of creating specialized sub-agents that enhance code quality through focused expertise and automated improvements.

**Context:** This sample blueprint illustrates agent development within the SDD assembly line pattern, showing how to create sub-agents that complement the core Coder Agent by providing specialized capabilities. It represents a realistic development scenario where code quality needs to be maintained consistently across different types of implementations.

**Goal:** Create a sub-agent file (`.claude/agents/formatter.md`) that implements intelligent code formatting logic, capable of analyzing generated code for style consistency, applying project-specific formatting rules, and ensuring all output meets established quality standards while preserving functional correctness.

## 2. The Contract: Requirements & Test Cases

**What it is:** The specific, testable requirements for creating a specialized formatting agent that demonstrates agent development patterns.

* **Behavior 1: Sub-Agent Configuration and Specialization**
  * **Given:** The formatter.md file is created in `.claude/agents/`
  * **When:** The sub-agent is invoked through Claude Code's Task tool
  * **Then:** It must use appropriate model selection optimized for code analysis and formatting tasks
  * **And:** It must include proper YAML frontmatter with specialized tools for code manipulation
  * **And:** It must operate with clean context isolation focused on formatting tasks only
  * **And:** The agent must be configured to analyze and improve code without changing functionality

* **Behavior 2: Code Style Analysis and Consistency**
  * **Given:** Generated code files are provided for formatting review
  * **When:** The Formatter Agent processes the code
  * **Then:** It must identify style inconsistencies, naming convention violations, and formatting issues
  * **And:** It must apply consistent indentation, spacing, and bracket placement according to language standards
  * **And:** It must standardize variable naming, function signatures, and comment formatting
  * **And:** All formatting changes must preserve original code functionality and logic

* **Behavior 3: Language-Specific Formatting Rules**
  * **Given:** Code in different programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
  * **When:** The agent analyzes files for formatting improvements
  * **Then:** It must apply language-appropriate formatting rules and conventions
  * **And:** It must handle language-specific features like Python indentation, JavaScript semicolon rules, and TypeScript type annotations
  * **And:** It must respect existing project configuration files (prettier, black, eslint configs)
  * **And:** Formatting must enhance readability without introducing syntax errors

* **Behavior 4: Integration with Code Generation Workflow**
  * **Given:** The formatter agent is part of the SDD assembly line
  * **When:** Code generation and formatting workflows execute
  * **Then:** The agent must integrate seamlessly with Coder Agent output without conflicts
  * **And:** It must provide clear formatting reports showing improvements made
  * **And:** It must handle edge cases gracefully, such as malformed or incomplete code
  * **And:** The agent must maintain consistent formatting standards across all SDD-generated code

## 3. Context Bundle (Agent-Populated Sibling Files)

**What it is:** Context files that will be provided by other agents for this task.

* **`bundle_architecture.md`:** Sub-agent design patterns for specialized code processing tasks, integration patterns with existing SDD agent workflow, code analysis and manipulation architectural guidelines, and formatting agent specialization strategies within assembly line methodology
* **`bundle_security.md`:** Secure code analysis practices that don't execute or evaluate code, safe file manipulation patterns for formatting operations, input validation for code processing without security vulnerabilities, and protection against malicious code injection through formatting operations
* **`bundle_code_context.md`:** Existing sub-agent implementation patterns and examples, code formatting tool integration approaches, language-specific formatting rule implementations, and Claude Code sub-agent creation patterns with appropriate tool configurations

---

## 4. Verification Context

**What it is:** Guidance for validating this task's completion.

* **Unit Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that the formatter.md sub-agent follows Claude Code sub-agent specifications, includes appropriate model and tool configurations, and contains robust code analysis logic that handles various programming languages correctly
* **Integration Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must test sub-agent invocation through the SDD workflow, verify formatting operations preserve code functionality, and validate that formatted code meets established style guidelines and project standards
* **Code Quality Test Scope:** The Validator Agent must verify that formatting operations improve code readability without introducing bugs, test edge case handling for malformed or incomplete code, and confirm consistent formatting application across different code types
* **Project-Wide Checks:** The Validator Agent must ensure the formatter agent integrates properly with the SDD assembly line pattern, maintains consistency with project coding standards, and enhances rather than interferes with the core code generation workflow

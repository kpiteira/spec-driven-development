## 1. Core User Stories

- **As a Human Architect, I want to initialize a new project** so that I can set up the required specification structure for a greenfield project.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to onboard an existing project** so that the system can discover its structure and prepare it for spec-driven development.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to plan a new milestone** so that I can define the goals and sequence of tasks for the next phase of work.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to launch the execution of an entire milestone** so that the system can autonomously work through all its tasks in sequence without losing context.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to initiate a single development task** so that the AI can generate code with full context, security guidance, and automated validation.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to be notified of key events** so that I can monitor progress and intervene when necessary without constant polling.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Commands

The Claude Code CLI shall be configured with the following custom commands:

- **`/init_greenfield`** (REQ-001): Creates complete project specifications using hybrid Main Agent + Sub-Agent approach.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** I am in a new project directory
    - **When** I execute `/init_greenfield`

## 4. User Experience (UX) and Interface (UI)

### 4.1. Command-Line Interface (Developer Experience)

**Design Principles:**

- **Discoverability:** Commands follow intuitive naming conventions (`/init_*`, `/plan_*`)
- **Feedback:** All operations provide immediate status feedback and progress updates
- **Error Clarity:** Failures include specific remediation guidance
- **Consistency:** All commands follow the same input validation and error reporting patterns

**Command Interface Standards:**

- **Parameter Validation:** Commands validate inputs before execution and provide helpful error messages
- **Progress Reporting:** Long-running operations (like `/milestone`) provide incremental progress updates
- **Status Persistence:** Command results are logged via hooks for later inspection
- **Graceful Degradation:** Commands fail safely without corrupting the workspace

**Command Frontmatter Requirements (REQ-CMD-001):** All SDD commands must include YAML frontmatter with:

- **`model`:** Strategic commands (`/init_greenfield`, `/plan_milestone`) use `opus`; implementation commands (`/task`, `/milestone`) use `sonnet`
- **`description`:** Clear, concise command purpose for discoverability
- **`argument-hint`:** Expected parameters for auto-completion (e.g., `[milestone-name]` for `/plan_milestone`)
- **`allowed-tools`:** Minimal required tools for security and performance (typically file operations and template access)

### 4.2. File-Based Interface

**Specification Document Experience:**

- **Template-Driven:** All specifications are created from consistent, well-documented templates
- **Human-Readable:** Documents use clear markdown with embedded examples and guidance
- **Version-Controlled:** All specifications integrate seamlessly with Git workflows
- **Cross-Referenced:** Documents include explicit links to related specifications

**Task Bundle Inspection:**

- **Transparent Context:** Users can inspect all agent-generated context files
- **Clear Structure:** Bundle organization follows predictable patterns
- **Debugging Support:** Failed bundles are preserved for troubleshooting

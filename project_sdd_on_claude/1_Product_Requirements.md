# Product Requirements: SDD System for Claude Code

This document outlines the complete functional requirements for the Spec-Driven Development system implemented on the Claude Code platform.

## 1. Core User Stories

- **As a Human Architect, I want to initialize a new project** so that I can set up the required specification structure for a greenfield project.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to onboard an existing project** so that the system can discover its structure and prepare it for spec-driven development.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to plan a new milestone** so that I can define the goals and sequence of tasks for the next phase of work.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to launch the execution of an entire milestone** so that the system can autonomously work through all its tasks in sequence without losing context.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to initiate a single development task** so that the AI can generate code with full context, security guidance, and automated validation.
- **As a Human Architect, I want to be notified of key events** so that I can monitor progress and intervene when necessary without constant polling.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Commands

The Claude Code CLI shall be configured with the following custom commands:

- `/init_greenfield`: Creates the `specs/` directory and populates it with the standard templates.
- `/init_brownfield`: Initiates the codebase discovery workflow to generate "as-is" specifications for an existing project.
- `/plan_milestone [name]`: Guides the user through creating a new `Milestone_Plan.md` based on the project roadmap.
- `/milestone [name]`: Launches the autonomous execution of all tasks within a specified milestone plan.
- `/task [task_id]`: Triggers the full, automated task execution workflow (Bundler -> Security -> Coder -> Validator).

### 2.2. Sub-Agents

The system shall implement the following sub-agents, each with a distinct role:

- **`Bundler`**:
  - Analyzes a `Task_Blueprint.md`.
  - Scans the local project codebase to find relevant code and interfaces.
  - Scans external sources for third-party library and SDK documentation.
  - Assembles a complete, actionable context bundle for the Coder.
- **`SecurityConsultant`**:
  - Analyzes the task description for potential security vulnerabilities.
  - Provides proactive, actionable security guidance in the task bundle.
- **`Validator`**:
  - Runs the project's test suite against the newly generated code.
  - Performs static analysis (linting, type checking).
  - Reports a clear `pass` or `fail` verdict.

### 2.3. Hooks & Notifications

- The system shall use hooks to send notifications to the Human Architect for key events, including:
  - Task completion (pass or fail).
  - Milestone completion.
  - Errors requiring human intervention.

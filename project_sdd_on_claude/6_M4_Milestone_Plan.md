# Milestone Plan: M4 - Sequential Milestone Execution

**Purpose of this document:** This document provides a detailed tactical plan for implementing the `/milestone [name]` command that enables Claude Code agents to read and understand any milestone plan document, then execute its tasks sequentially, allowing Human Architects to execute complete milestones autonomously with robust error handling and progress reporting.

## 1. Milestone Goals & Success Criteria

**Goal:** Create the `/milestone [name]` command that enables Claude Code agents to read and comprehend milestone plan documents, then orchestrate sequential task execution, transforming the SDD system from individual task automation to complete milestone workflow automation.

**Success Criteria:**
* **Given** any milestone plan with task sequences (e.g., M1-Foundation, M2-TaskExecution, M3-Validation)
* **When** I execute `/milestone [milestone-name]`
* **Then** the Claude Code agent reads and understands the milestone plan document to identify all TASK-XXX identifiers and executes them in the order specified
* **And** executes tasks sequentially using existing `/task` command infrastructure from M2
* **And** operates autonomously during normal execution without user prompts
* **And** asks for user input when genuinely needed (not for failures - those stop execution)
* **And** stops on any failure, explains the problem clearly, and asks what to do next
* **And** provides clear progress reporting throughout execution
* **And** supports resume capability by detecting completed tasks and continuing from where it left off
* **And** integrates with existing hook system for task completion notifications

**User Value Delivered:**
* Human Architects can execute entire milestones through a single command
* Autonomous execution allows architects to focus on other work while milestone progresses
* Resume capability handles interruptions gracefully without losing progress
* Clear failure handling preserves context and enables informed decision-making

## 2. Scope: Features & Requirements

**Functional Requirements In Scope:**
* **REQ-004**: `/milestone [name]` command enables Claude Code agents to autonomously execute all tasks within a specified milestone plan
* Sequential task execution based on Claude Code agent comprehension of TASK-XXX sequences from milestone plans
* Resume capability using task bundle state analysis
* Clear progress reporting during milestone execution
* Stop-on-failure handling with user decision prompts
* Autonomous execution during normal operation, with user prompts when Claude Code agent needs genuine guidance from Human Architects
* Generic milestone support - Claude Code agent works with any milestone plan document, not just specific ones

**Non-Functional Requirements In Scope:**
* **NFR-REL-002**: Failure isolation - failed operations leave system in recoverable state
* **NFR-UX-001**: Command clarity with comprehensive progress feedback and clear failure reporting
* **NFR-PERF-005**: Implementation efficiency using `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for orchestration

**Integration Points:**
* **Task Infrastructure**: Build upon M2's `/task` command and task bundle system (`.task_bundles/TASK-ID/`)
* **Hook System**: Leverage existing notification system for milestone events
* **State Management**: Use file-based state for resume capabilities and progress tracking

**Explicitly Out of Scope:**
* Parallel task execution (over-complicates Claude Code agent coordination)
* Complex dependency analysis (sequential execution based on milestone plan document order)
* Concurrent milestone execution (one milestone at a time keeps Claude Code agent focus clear)
* Auto-rollback on failure (Human Architect maintains control over recovery decisions)

## 3. Implementation Plan: Vertical Slices

### **Slice 1: Basic Sequential Task Execution**

**Goal:** Create the foundational `/milestone` command that enables Claude Code agents to read and understand milestone plan documents, then execute their task sequences sequentially using existing infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** I have any milestone plan document (e.g., `4_M1_Milestone_Plan.md`, `5_M2_Milestone_Plan.md`)
* **When** I execute `/milestone M1-Foundation`
* **Then** the Claude Code agent reads and understands the milestone plan document to identify all TASK-XXX identifiers from Implementation Plan sections
* **And** executes tasks sequentially in the order they appear in the milestone plan
* **And** each task uses the existing `/task TASK-ID` command from M2
* **And** provides clear progress updates (e.g., "Starting TASK-001 [1/5]", "Completed TASK-001 [1/5]")
* **And** stops immediately on any task failure with clear error reporting

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-019:** Create `.claude/commands/milestone.md` command that enables Claude Code agents to read and understand milestone plan documents using natural language comprehension, then execute TASK-XXX sequences sequentially

---

### **Slice 2: Error Handling and Progress Reporting**

**Goal:** Add comprehensive error handling and enhanced progress visibility for milestone execution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** I run `/milestone M1-Foundation`
* **When** the Claude Code agent executes tasks sequentially
* **Then** I receive clear progress updates after each task completion
* **And** any task failures immediately stop execution and the Claude Code agent provides detailed error information
* **And** the Claude Code agent preserves all task bundle context for debugging
* **And** failure messages include specific guidance on next steps (retry, investigate, abort)
* **And** I can see which tasks completed successfully and which task failed

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-020:** Enable Claude Code agent to provide comprehensive error handling with clear failure reporting and execution state preservation
2. **TASK-021:** Enable Claude Code agent to provide enhanced progress reporting with detailed milestone status and completion tracking

---

### **Slice 3: Resume Capability and State Management**

**Goal:** Add resume functionality that allows milestone execution to continue from where it left off after interruptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** a milestone execution was interrupted after completing some tasks
* **When** I re-execute `/milestone M1-Foundation`
* **Then** the Claude Code agent analyzes existing `.task_bundles/` directories to understand which tasks are completed
* **And** automatically resumes from the first uncompleted task
* **And** displays clear status about which tasks are being skipped (e.g., "TASK-001 already completed, skipping...")
* **And** continues execution seamlessly without requiring user confirmation
* **And** handles partially completed tasks by restarting them from the beginning

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-022:** Enable Claude Code agent to track milestone state using `.milestone_bundles/[name]/` directory structure
2. **TASK-023:** Enable Claude Code agent to implement resume logic by analyzing task bundle status and continuing from correct checkpoint
3. **TASK-024:** Enable Claude Code agent to handle milestone state cleanup and completion

---

### **Slice 4: Autonomous Execution and Hook Integration**

**Goal:** Enable Claude Code agent to execute milestones autonomously with appropriate Human Architect interaction and integration with existing notification system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** a milestone is executing normally
* **When** tasks complete successfully
* **Then** execution continues autonomously without user prompts
* **And** integrates with existing hook system to provide sound notifications
* **And** generates milestone completion reports with execution summary
* **And** asks for Human Architect input only when the Claude Code agent genuinely needs guidance (not for routine decisions)
* **And** maintains autonomous operation as the default behavior for the Claude Code agent

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-025:** Enable Claude Code agent to implement autonomous execution logic with appropriate Human Architect interaction points
2. **TASK-026:** Enable Claude Code agent to integrate with existing hook system for milestone-level notifications
3. **TASK-027:** Enable Claude Code agent to perform milestone completion validation and reporting

---

### **Slice 5: Comprehensive Retrospective and Learning Integration**

**Goal:** Enable comprehensive retrospective analysis that starts with Claude Code agent self-introspection, followed by Human Architect feedback collection, creating actionable learning documents for future milestone planning and execution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* **Given** a milestone planning session is complete OR a milestone execution is complete
* **When** the retrospective process is triggered
* **Then** Claude Code agents first perform comprehensive self-analysis of issues they encountered during the process
* **And** agents analyze patterns of confusion, errors, or inefficiencies they experienced
* **And** agents generate initial retrospective insights and recommendations based on their experience
* **And** the system presents the agent self-analysis to the Human Architect and asks for additional feedback
* **And** creates comprehensive retrospective documents that combine agent insights with human feedback
* **And** stores retrospectives for integration into future planning processes (as referenced in `/plan_milestone` Phase 2.6)

**Task Sequence:**
1. **TASK-028:** Enable Claude Code agents to collect and analyze self-introspection data throughout planning and execution processes
2. **TASK-029:** Create agent-driven retrospective analysis that identifies process issues, confusion points, and improvement opportunities
3. **TASK-030:** Integrate agent self-analysis with Human Architect feedback to create comprehensive retrospective documents for future process improvement

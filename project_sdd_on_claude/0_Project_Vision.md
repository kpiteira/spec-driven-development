# Project Vision: The SDD System for Claude Code

## 1. The Core Problem
Software development with LLMs suffers from context degradation, loss of focus, and non-adherence to architectural principles. This leads to inconsistent quality and requires constant human oversight for low-level tasks.

## 2. Our Solution
We will implement the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology as a configured extension of the Claude Code CLI. This system will create a symbiotic relationship between a Human Architect, who defines the "what" and "why," and an AI execution engine (Claude Code), which handles the "how."

The system will use formal specifications as a machine-readable contract to ensure the AI acts as a disciplined, tireless builder, translating the architect's intent into high-quality, compliant code.

## 3. The North Star
To elevate the developer's role from a mechanic to an engineer. By automating the low-level, repetitive tasks of coding and context gathering, the developer can focus on strategic design and problem-solving, making development a more predictable, scalable, and reliable engineering discipline.

## 4. Key Principles
- **Human as Architect:** The developer's primary role is to define intent through specifications.
- **Spec as Contract:** The specification is the single source of truth.
- **AI as Disciplined Builder:** The AI executes tasks strictly within the boundaries of the spec.
- **System as Guardian:** The workflow enforces compliance and quality automatically.

# Project Vision: The SDD System for Claude Code

**Purpose of this document:** The Project Vision serves as the "North Star" for the entire project. It is the single source of truth for the project's purpose and strategic goals. It ensures that all stakeholders, from developers to executives, are aligned on *why* this project exists and what it aims to achieve.

---

## 1. Mission Statement

To transform software development into a predictable engineering discipline by creating a symbiotic relationship between human architects and AI builders, mediated by formal specifications that ensure quality, security, and architectural compliance.

---

## 2. The Core Problem

Software development with LLMs suffers from context degradation, loss of focus, and non-adherence to architectural principles. This leads to inconsistent quality and requires constant human oversight for low-level tasks.

**Current Pain Points:**

- **Context Loss:** LLMs lose track of architectural decisions and project patterns as conversations progress
- **Quality Inconsistency:** Without formal contracts, AI-generated code varies in quality and adherence to standards
- **Manual Oversight:** Developers must constantly review and correct AI output, negating productivity gains
- **Architectural Drift:** Projects lose consistency as AI makes isolated decisions without system-wide context

---

## 3. Our Solution

We will implement the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology as a configured extension of the Claude Code CLI. This system will create a symbiotic relationship between a Human Architect, who defines the "what" and "why," and an AI execution engine (Claude Code), which handles the "how."

The system will use formal specifications as a machine-readable contract to ensure the AI acts as a disciplined, tireless builder, translating the architect's intent into high-quality, compliant code.

## 4. Target Audience / User Personas

### Primary Persona: "Alex the Human Architect"

**Role:** Senior Software Developer / Technical Lead
**Experience:** 5+ years in software development, familiar with architectural patterns and development workflows
**Goals:**

- Focus on high-level design and strategic technical decisions
- Automate repetitive coding and implementation tasks
- Maintain architectural consistency across the project
- Ensure code quality and security without manual oversight

**Frustrations:**

- Spending time on boilerplate code and repetitive implementation tasks
- LLMs that don't follow established project patterns
- Inconsistent code quality from AI tools
- Having to constantly review and correct AI-generated code

**Technology Comfort:** High - comfortable with command-line tools, Git workflows, and development environments

**SDD Usage Patterns:**

- Defines project vision and architectural specifications
- Creates milestone plans and task blueprints
- Reviews AI-generated code for strategic correctness
- Iterates on specifications based on project learnings

## 5. The North Star

To elevate the developer's role from a mechanic to an engineer. By automating the low-level, repetitive tasks of coding and context gathering, the developer can focus on strategic design and problem-solving, making development a more predictable, scalable, and reliable engineering discipline.

**Success Vision:** A world where software development is as predictable and reliable as other engineering disciplines, where AI handles implementation while humans focus on design, strategy, and innovation.

## 7. Key Principles

- **Human as Architect:** The developer's primary role is to define intent through specifications.
- **Spec as Contract:** The specification is the single source of truth.
- **AI as Disciplined Builder:** The AI executes tasks strictly within the boundaries of the spec.
- **System as Guardian:** The workflow enforces compliance and quality automatically.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults:** When uncertain, the system chooses the safer, more conservative option.
- **Transparency:** All AI decisions and context are visible and auditable.

## 8. Explicitly Out of Scope

**Current Version Will NOT Include:**

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple developers working simultaneously on the same specifications
- **Visual Specification Tools:** GUI-based specification creation (command-line and file-based only)
- **External Integrations:** CI/CD pipeline integration, external project management tools
- **Performance Optimization:** AI model optimization or custom LLM training
- **Multi-Language Support:** Initial focus on single programming language per project
- **Enterprise Features:** SSO, advanced permissions, enterprise reporting dashboards

**Future Consideration (Not Current Scope):**

- Integration with IDEs beyond Claude Code
- Distributed development team coordination
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Custom AI model training for domain-specific patterns

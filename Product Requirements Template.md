# Product Requirements: [Project Name]

**Purpose of this document:** This document translates the project vision into tangible features, constraints, and requirements. It defines *what* the system must do from a user's perspective. It is the primary input for the architecture, design, and development teams. A well-crafted PRD is a living document that serves as a single source of truth for the product's intended functionality.

## 1. Functional Requirements

**What it is:** This section details the specific functionalities of the product, typically framed as user stories. It moves from high-level features (Epics) to granular, actionable stories.

**Best Practices:**

* **Structure:** Organize stories under larger features called "Epics" for clarity.
* **Traceability:** Assign a unique ID to every requirement (e.g., `REQ-001`) so it can be traced from conception through testing to release.
* **Prioritization:** Each feature or story should have a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low, or using a MoSCoW framework: Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have). This is critical for planning and phased rollouts.

### 1.1. User Stories

A user story captures a single feature from an end-user's perspective.

* **Format:** "As a `<user persona>`, I want to `<perform an action>` so that I can `<achieve a goal>`."
* **The "Why":** Never neglect the "so that..." part. It provides critical context for the development team and justifies the feature's existence.

### 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

**This is the most critical part of a user story.** Acceptance criteria define the specific, testable conditions that must be met for the story to be considered "done." They eliminate ambiguity.

* **Format:** The `Given-When-Then` format from Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is highly effective.
  * **Given:** The initial context or state.
  * **When:** The action the user performs.
  * **Then:** The expected outcome or result.

**Example:**

* **Epic:** User Account Management
* **Priority:** High

* **User Story (REQ-001):** As a new user, I want to sign up with my email and password so that I can access the platform.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * **Scenario 1: Successful Signup**
      * **Given** I am on the signup page
      * **And** I have entered a valid, unique email and a strong password
      * **When** I click the "Sign Up" button
      * **Then** my account is created
      * **And** I am redirected to the login page
      * **And** I see a message confirming my successful registration.
    * **Scenario 2: Email Already Exists**
      * **Given** I am on the signup page
      * **And** I have entered an email that already exists in the system
      * **When** I click the "Sign Up" button
      * **Then** I see an error message stating "This email address is already in use."

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**What it is:** The quality attributes and constraints that define *how well* the system should operate. NFRs are not about what the system *does*, but about *what it is*. They are a primary input for the `Validator` and `Security` agents.

**Best Practices:**

* **Be Specific and Quantifiable:** Avoid vague terms like "fast" or "secure." Quantify them with numbers, standards, and clear metrics. This is non-negotiable for NFRs to be useful.
* **Categorize:** Group NFRs into logical categories to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Example Categories

#### 2.1. Performance & Scalability

* **NFR-001 (Response Time):** All API endpoints must have a median response time of less than 200ms and a 99th percentile response time of less than 800ms under a load of 1000 requests per second.
* **NFR-002 (Load Capacity):** The system must support 10,000 concurrent active users with no more than a 10% degradation in response time.

#### 2.2. Availability & Reliability

* **NFR-003 (Uptime):** The public-facing services must have a 99.9% uptime, measured monthly.
* **NFR-004 (Recovery):** In case of a critical database failure, the system must be recoverable within 1 hour (Recovery Time Objective), with no more than 5 minutes of data loss (Recovery Point Objective).

#### 2.3. Security

* **NFR-005 (Compliance):** The system must be compliant with the OWASP Top 10 security risks. All code must be scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **NFR-006 (Data Protection):** All user Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).

#### 2.4. Usability & Accessibility

* **NFR-007 (Learnability):** A new user must be able to complete the primary user journey (e.g., creating and publishing a website) in under 5 minutes without consulting documentation.
* **NFR-008 (Accessibility):** The web interface must be compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.

#### 2.5. Maintainability

* **NFR-009 (Test Coverage):** All new backend code must have a minimum of 85% unit test coverage.
* **NFR-010 (Code Quality):** Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) must not exceed a score of 10 for any single function.

## 3. User Experience (UX) and Interface (UI)

**What it is:** This section defines the product's look, feel, and interaction model. For any product with an interface (graphical, command-line, or API), this is an essential component.

**Best Practices:**

* **Visuals over Text:** Use diagrams, links to wireframes, and mockups wherever possible.
* **Define Principles:** Establish high-level principles that guide the user experience.

### 3.1. User Flow Diagrams

* For complex processes (e.g., user onboarding, multi-step forms), include a diagram illustrating the user's path through the application, including decision points and different states.
* **Link to User Flows:** `[Link to diagrams in Miro, Figma, or other tool]`

### 3.2. UI/UX Principles & Wireframes

* **For GUIs:**
  * **Design System/Style Guide:** `[Link to Figma project, Storybook, or style guide]`
  * **Guiding Principles:**
    * **Consistency:** UI elements and flows are consistent throughout the application.
    * **Feedback:** The system provides clear, immediate feedback for user actions.
* **For APIs/CLIs (Developer Experience):**
  * **API Design Conventions:** We will follow RESTful principles (or GraphQL, gRPC, etc.).
  * **Authentication:** All endpoints will be secured via OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens.
  * **Error Handling:** API errors will return standardized, informative JSON bodies.
  * **Documentation:** API documentation will be generated automatically and will be interactive (e.g., via Swagger/OpenAPI).

## 4. Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies

**What it is:** A list of all known assumptions, technical or business constraints, and external factors the project relies on. Making these explicit is crucial for risk management.

* **Assumptions:** Things you are holding to be true for planning purposes.
  * *Example:* "We assume users will access the application primarily on modern desktop browsers."
* **Constraints:** Business or technical limitations that must be adhered to.
  * *Example:* "The project budget cannot exceed $50,000." or "The system must be built using the existing corporate AWS infrastructure."
* **Dependencies:** External teams, services, or events that the project needs to succeed.
  * *Example:* "The project is dependent on the Marketing team to provide final copy by `[Date]`." or "The payment feature relies on the successful integration of the Stripe API."
